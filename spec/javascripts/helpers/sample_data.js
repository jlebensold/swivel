          "body": "<p>A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p><h2><a href=\"http://marketingland.com/if-googles-really-proud-of-google-it-should-share-some-real-user-figures-9796\">If Google's Really Proud Of Google+, It Should Share Some Real User Figures &gt;&gt; MarketingLand</a></h2><p>Danny Sullivan, in a long, long post: </p><blockquote><p>I've been meaning to write my \"Google+ Is Like The Apple Store For Google\" piece for some time. Maybe I'll never get to it now. But you know when you go into an Apple Store, and it's filled with sometimes scary Apple fanatics who seem to have arrived at a holy place? That's Google+ for Google.</p><p> If Google+ isn't anything else, it's a place that Google fans can call home. It's a place that Google's never really had before, a spot for its millions (and let's face it, there are millions) of fanboys and fangirls to rejoice in all things Google.</p><p> I've experienced this firsthand in my time at Google. I've learned that if I share anything negative about Google, I can expect to get comments, sometimes many, asking why I hate Google or am biased against Google.</p></blockquote><p> Sullivan generally writes positively about Google, and you can see how wrestling with his dislike of its slipperiness over Google+. The \"170m\" figure this week seems to have been the last straw, and won't have been improved by the complete lack of useful numbers in Thurday's quarterly results.</p><h2><a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57412861-38/doj-is-likely-to-lose-e-book-antitrust-suit-targeting-apple/\">DOJ is likely to lose e-book antitrust suit targeting Apple &gt;&gt; CNET News</a></h2><blockquote><p>The Department of Justice \"has a far better case against the publishers than Apple,\" says Dominick Armentano, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Hartford and author of Antitrust and Monopoly who's now affiliated with the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif. \"If the CEOs of the various publishers got together in hotel rooms to discuss prices, they are sunk\" and might as well settle, he says.</p></blockquote><p> Pretty much only leaves MacMillan to have to fight, then.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/news/2012/04/world-bank-demands-open-data-google-mapping-project/\">The World Bank demands open data in Google mapping project &gt;&gt; Publish What You Fund</a></h2><blockquote><p>The World Bank has confirmed that it will not support the use of Google Map Maker for citizen-mapping efforts unless it gives users free access to the map data they create.</p><p> The World Bank and Google have launched a project using crowd-sourcing to populate maps with the locations of public services in the developing world - a resource which could be used by many different groups in humanitarian and longer-term development work.</p></blockquote><p> Good move by the World Bank.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2012/04/12/how-samsung-beat-nokia/\">How Samsung beat Nokia &gt;&gt; asymco</a></h2><p>Horace Dediu cuts to the chase: </p><blockquote><p>Looking at product mix, Samsung growth is shown to be almost entirely due to smartphones while Nokia's stagnant growth seems to be a failure to have any smartphone traction.</p><p> It's even more clear when showing the above mixes of devices as percents of total.</p></blockquote><p> Note that it's not as simple as \"Android\": HTC, Motorola, LG and Sony Ericsson have all adopted Android too, but all dwindled (some even worse than Nokia). Samsung has stayed ahead of the curve. Its success is completely deserved.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5cL60TYY8oQ\">Inside Foxconn: Exclusive look at how an iPad is made &gt;&gt; YouTube</a></h2><p>Rob Schmitz (who was one of those suspicious about Mike Daisey's claims about Foxconn working conditions) gets inside a factory and gets filming.</p><h2><a href=\"http://waxy.org/2012/04/instagrams_buyout_how_does_it_measure_up/\">Instagram's Buyout: How Does It Measure Up? &gt;&gt; Waxy.org</a></h2><p>Andy Baio: </p><blockquote><p>The spreadsheet below captures the acquisition date, dollar amounts, and ballpark counts of the users and employees at the time of acquisition. Be warned: any of these numbers are very rough, cobbled together from Internet Archive searches, old news articles, Quora answers, and tech blogs. If you have more accurate information, please leave a comment and I'll fix it.</p></blockquote><p> Upshot: Instagram is a long way from being the most expensive purchase on a per-user basis from the past 13 years. To repeat: Instagram isn't the purchase that marks the top of the bubble. It's part of the bubble.</p><h2><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5242\">About Java for OS X Lion 2012-003 &gt;&gt; Apple</a></h2><blockquote><p>This Java security update removes the most common variants of the Flashback malware.</p><p> This update also configures the Java web plug-in to disable the automatic execution of Java applets. Users may re-enable automatic execution of Java applets using the Java Preferences application. If the Java web plug-in detects that no applets have been run for an extended period of time it will again disable Java applets.</p></blockquote><p> Next step: just zap Java altogether. Works on 10.6 and 10.7. Users of 10.5... should disable Java?</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/04/apple-is-allowed-at-long-last-to.html\">Apple is allowed (at long last) to intervene in Lodsys lawsuit against app developers &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents</a></h2><p>Florian Müller: </p><blockquote><p>I wish the app developer community luck as far as Lodsys is concerned. I saw that some of the smaller defendants, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/gedeon/status/190541152125059073\">including Iconfactory</a>, settled the dispute on undisclosed terms, presumably because they couldn't afford the cost and deal with risk of protracted litigation. I wish the remaining defendants as well as all those facing the threat of being sued that Apple's intervention will help to get his troll defeated. I also hope that <a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2011/08/googles-reexamination-requests-against.html\">Google's reexamination requests</a> will be successful. I still believe that those large players should do a whole lot more for app developers than what they are doing at this stage (for example, I believe they should give them blanket coverage against litigation costs)</p></blockquote><p> Let the games really begin.</p><p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

          "headline": "Hillary Clinton and G8 ministers: peace monitors must be sent to Syria",
          "body": "<p>Foreign ministers from the world's leading industrial countries ended a two-day meeting in Washington expressing a joint determination to see international peace monitors deployed in Syria as fast as possible to observe the shaky ceasefire.</p><p>Although the G8 foreign ministers' summit discussed issues from the weekend nuclear talks with Iran to the imminent launch of a North Korean long-range missile, ministers devoted most of it to the clashes in Syria that have left an estimated 9,000 dead.</p><p>The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, noted that the ceasefire negotiated by the former United Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, appeared to be holding, adding pointedly: \"At least for the moment\".</p><p>Ministers expressed concern that the tentative ceasefire might collapse before any significant moves, chiefly the deployment of monitors, are taken. </p><p>\"If it holds, a ceasefire is an important step, but it represents just one element of the special envoy's plan,\" Clinton told reporters at a state department press conference at the end of the summit. If monitors are in place, the next step would be the withdrawal of Syrian government forces from cities where rebels have strongholds and eventually a political settlement.</p><p>The foreign ministers from G8 – made up of the US, Russia, Japan, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and and Italy – met in Washington to lay the ground for a meeting of G8 leaders at Camp David next month.</p><p>Before the foreign ministers gathered, one of the main worries of diplomats from the US and Europe was how to keep Russia on board. Russia, a long-time ally of Syria, has repeatedly blocked moves by the UN security council against Syrian president Bashar Assad. But Russia has signed up to Annan's peace plan, and the other seven G8 countries held it to those pledges.</p><p>Clinton met on the sidelines with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, specifically on Syria.</p><p>At the press conference, Clinton warned Assad against failure to implement the plan in full. \"The Annan plan is not a menu of options. It is a set of obligations,\" she said. \"The burden of fully and visibly meeting all of these obligations continues to rest with the regime. They cannot pick and choose.</p><p>For it to be meaningful, this apparent halt in violence must lead to a credible political process and a peaceful, inclusive democratic transition.\"</p><p>The Obama administration's line on Syria goes further than either the G8 nor the UN by calling on Assad to stand down. \"We remain firmly resolved that the regime's war against its own people must end for good and political transition must begin,\" Clinton said. \"Assad will have to go and the Syrian people must be given the chance to chart their own future.\"</p><p>Another pressing issue, unable to wait until the full G8 meets next month,  is North Korea. Diplomats warned that it would be \"inadvisable\" for North Korea to launch, as planned, its long-range missile as this would renew tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>\"We urge the North Korean leadership to honour its agreements and refrain from pursuing a cycle of provocation,\" Clinton said.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Syria&k=Hillary+Clinton&k=G8&k=World+news&k=United+Nations&k=US+foreign+policy\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Hillary+Clinton+and+G8+ministers%3A+peace+monitors+must+be+sent+to+Syria+Article+1730750&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Syria+%28News%29%2CHillary+Clinton+%28News%29%2CG8+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CUnited+Nations+%28News%29%2CUS+foreign+policy%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730750&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/12/hillary-clinton-g8-peace-monitors-syria|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|4dd8e713ef20584f45d1d5f5560d2d0ceec5f2a3 -->",

          "body": "<!-- Block 1 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.00am:</span> Good morning and welcome to our live blog politics coverage! Tom McCarthy here in New York and here's where things stand:</p><p><strong>• A televised remark by a Democratic strategist that Ann Romney, the wife of Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney and mother of his five children, has \"never worked a day in her life\" has created a cyclone of indignation.</strong> Ann Romney started a Twitter account and said raising five kids was work, thank you very much. The Obama campaign is on the defensive.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.</p><p>— Ann Romney (@AnnDRomney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnDRomney/status/190262588163100672\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T02:18:30+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>• <strong>Ann Romney will appear on television soon to talk about her husband's plan for women and the economy, and to discuss the remarks of the Democratic strategist, Hilary Rosen</strong>. The kerfuffle follows a Washington Post/ABC News poll earlier this week showing Obama with a 19-point lead over Romney among women.</p><p>• <strong>The Obama campaign has produced a video marking the sixth anniversary of Mitt Romney's Massachusetts health care plan, signed into law on April 12, 2006.</strong> This is an attempt to preempt attacks on Obama's health care plan. We'll post the video momentarily.</p><p>• <strong>President Obama will honor NASCAR champ Tony Stewart and other drivers in a White House ceremony. </strong>Will Danica Patrick be there? And will there be photos?</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.28am:</span> My colleague Ryan Devereaux has been looking into the Rosen brouhaha in more depth.</p><p>Barack Obama's senior advisers went into damage control mode immediately after Hilary Rosen's CNN appearance last night, with campaign manager <strong>Jim Messina</strong> and top strategist <strong>David Axelrod</strong> both taking to Twitter.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly. Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize.</p><p>— Jim Messina (@Messina2012) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Messina2012/status/190268575141986305\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T02:42:17+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p><br /><em></em></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney.They were inappropriate and offensive.</p><p>— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/190270056977022979\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T02:48:11+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>As the battle warms up between Obama and Romney over whose policies are better for women, the<strong> Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act</strong> has taken center stage. </p><p>Signed by President Obama, the law makes it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases. When asked about Romney's position on the act in a conference call on Wednesday, his top policy aides seemed unsure how to respond. The law is opposed by elements of the conservative base Romney seeks to please. The Romney campaign eventually released a statement saying he supports the radical notion of pay equity. The Democrats wasted no time in seizing on the opportunity to release citing Ledbetter's \"shocked and disappointed\" reaction to the controversy.</p><p>Romney's strategy for taking the president to task on women's issues includes arguing that women have suffered disproportionately under current White House policies, particularly in terms of job losses. </p><p>On Tuesday and Wednesday the former governor repeatedly cited the figure 92.3% figure, which he says it represents women's share of all the jobs lost since the president's inauguration in January 2009. But it turns out that's not quite accurate. Though women have lost a considerable number of jobs in the last three years, men lost way more during the recession (which officially began in December 2007). Men are also prone to work in sectors that are vulnerable swings in the business cycle.</p><p>Romney's advisers on women's issues include <strong>Bay Buchanan,</strong> sister of paleoconservative Pat Buchanan. Like her brother, Buchanan is known for making incendiary assertions. Among her more controversial statements are the suggestion that the nation's \"social decay\" is the result of the feminist movement, that feminism is rooted in fundamental failures (women don't value marriage and can only be happy outside the home, the sexual revolution made free-loving \"alley cats\" out of women and the defense of abortion, for example) and breast cancer may be the result of past abortions.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.57am:</span> <strong>Ann Romney</strong> has just appeared on Fox News to talk about Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen's comments, and she turns in an upbeat, on-point appearance. She's asked for her gut reaction to Rosen's comments. It turns out she's no more given to moments of nasty passion than her husband.</p><p>\"She should have come to my house when those five boys were causing so much trouble,\" Romney laughs. \"It wasn't so easy.\"</p><p>Then she pivots into her larger point, that one way is not better than another. \"We need to respect the choices that women make. We have to respect women in all those choices they make. … And we have to give a shout-out to all the dads who are at home raising kids.\"</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.05am:</span> More from <strong>Ann Romney's Fox News appearance.</strong> Her job here is to show her husband as a man who respects and loves his wife and holds women in general in high regard. </p><p>She accomplishes this by saying so, and also by coming across as a frank, intelligent, relatable (!) woman who we can guess would pick well in choosing a mate.</p><p>\"I will tell you that Mitt said to me more times than you can imagine: 'Ann your job is more important than mine,'\" she says. \"By the way, Mitt respects women that make those different choices. He listens to a lot of different women.\"</p><p>Then Romney shifts to her campaign boilerplate, the part where she is a mouthpiece for women across the country:</p><p>\"I want to tell you what women are telling me. Guess what women are talking about? Guess what? They're talking about jobs, and they're talking about the legacy of debt that we're leaving our children. That's what we're hearing. And that's what they're talking about here.\"</p><p>More effective is Romney's answer to Rosen's assertion that staying at home was her choice and she never had to worry about money.</p><p>\"I know what it's like to struggle,\" the breast cancer survivor says. \"Maybe I haven't struggled as much financially as some people have. But I can tell you that I have had struggle in my life. Mitt and I have compassion for people who are struggling. And that's why we're running.\" She comes across as sincere. She's helping her husband here.</p><p>Ann Romney shares this, however, with her husband: Even when she's being sincere, the language she uses is sometimes so artless – so tinny, so evocative of a computer programmed to carry on conversation – that it rings false:</p><p>\"You should see how many women he listens to. That's what I love about Mitt. There are so many around him who he respects and admires.... Mitt Romney is a person that admires women and listens to them. And I am grateful that he listens to me and what I am telling him about what women are facing right now.\"</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.17am:</span> Is the <strong>Hillary Rosen scandal</strong> a tempest in a teapot? Is this all just Republicans making hay of an innocuous lapse of speech by a political commentator? Or do Rosen's comments expose a real insensitivity among Democrats to the \"traditional\" family – or a point of conflict between two political philosophies? </p><p>For the record here's what Rosen said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With respect to economic issues, I think actually that Mitt Romney is right that ultimately women care more about the economic well-being of their family and the like.  But he doesn't connect on that issue, either.  What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country saying well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.  Guess what?  His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.  She's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why we worry about their future.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Let us know in the comments and later we'll discuss the most level-headed and incisive analyses.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.26am:</span> We're about five minutes away from a <strong>Romney campaign conference call</strong> on how the president's economy policies are \"failing women.\" Participating will be Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Rep. Cynthia Lummis. </p><p>How will the legislators make the case that President Obama is hurting women? Let's listen in!</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.45am:</span> Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) begins the <strong>Romney conference call</strong> by saying Hilary Rosen's comment was \"insulting.\" Ayotte has two kids. </p><p>\"Women have faced massive job losses under this administration,\" Ayotte says. \"I'm really worried about what we're leaving for the next generation in terms of the massive debt we've incurred under this president. ... I know that women, myself included, are concerned about what we're leaving for children.\"</p><p>There is an accidental conflict between the points the Romney camp is making this morning. Those points are: one, it's insulting to say that staying at home doesn't count as work. Two, not enough women are able to get jobs outside the home.</p><p>Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers on now. She says the \"war on women\" supposedly being waged by Republicans is a myth, the creation of the Democrats. \"What's really going on is a war on reality by the Democrats,\" she says.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.49am:</span> Waiting for someone on the <strong>Romney conference call</strong> to name an Obama policy that has hurt women's economic prospects. They're holding him responsible for jobs lost during the recession. That's an argument to be made. But it's a leap from there to get to \"Obama has been bad for women.\"</p><p>The argument the Obama camp has to make, that Romney's policies are antagonistic to women, is more concrete. Romney supports the overturning of Roe v. Wade. He wants to abolish Planned Parenthood. And he doesn't want employers to be required to cover contraception as part of their health insurance.</p><p>Those issues aren't the most important for every women voter. But they're part of the reason for that double-digit gap between the president and Romney among women.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.58am:</span> Let's drop <strong>that call</strong> for a moment (a moment that lasts forever). The point participants are making is that what Democratic adviser Hilary Rosen said about Ann Romney not working was offensive. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I apparently am on the \"Hillary Rosen speaks for Barack Obama\" conference call.</p><p>— John Dickerson (@johndickerson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johndickerson/status/190467800144429056\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T15:53:56+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.04pm:</span> Former Republican primary frontrunner <strong>Herman Cain</strong> is still making commercials, and they're still gonzo.

The Obama strategy in the general election is to paint Romney as a benighted conservative whom no Independent in his/her right mind would vote for. Highlighting Romney's moderate record as governor would be counterproductive. So the thinking went.</p><p>As if on cue, the Obama camp has released a three-minute video commemorating Romney's work on his state health care law.</p><p>The video depicts Romney as having executed an astoundingly brash about-face on health care reform.

Harris, </a>noting that both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are \"exceptionally self-contained, self-disciplined, self-motivated\" men, whose minds \"gravitate to rationality and logic—both of whom have expressed disdain for the disorder and surliness that pervade modern governance.\" </p><p>His point, it seems, is that for all the bombast and extremism of the current electoral process, come January we will have a President who is neither bombastic nor extreme (in many ways, not all, obviously). On the other hand, some of the Presidents he cites who are not like O and Mitt (Clinton, Johnson) were quite effective in their own ways.</p></blockquote><p>A point well made. One of the sharpest contrasts between the Obama presidency and that of George W. Bush has been in the leaders' rhetorical styles. Where Bush could be pugnacious, Obama projects tranquility; where Bush used the language of \"us vs. them,\" Obama talks a lot of kumbaya. Yet the tenor of national politics has not leavened under Obama. We still all hate each other, it seems. </p><p>The conclusion being that the president does not set the tone of the national politics.

In 1979, women ages 25 to 34 earned 68% what their male counterparts did. By 2010, they earned 91%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not there yet, employers.</p><p>• <strong>Newt Gingrich and Fox News got into a slapfight that we fear cannot but end unprettily.</strong> Gingrich said Fox was about as fair and balanced as a two-legged stool (to paraphrase).

          "body": "<p>\"It's been 40 years since I had a No 1 hit&nbsp;with Puppy Love,\" <strong>Donny Osmond</strong> told listeners to his new Sunday night show on <a href=\"http://www.smoothradio.co.uk/shows-presenters/donny-osmond-on-sunday-evenings/1eb4d\" title=\"Smooth Radio\">Smooth Radio</a>. Before playing the track, he recalled singing the song live on stage in the early days: \"The girls started screaming and I forgot the&nbsp;words.\"</p><p>The four-hour show from Las Vegas could do with a little more of this layer of him reminiscing about his career. Otherwise, it's several relaxed tracks played back to back, with gaps so long between Donny's links that you start wondering what on earth he might be doing during the music, and a smattering of slightly odd entertainment stories. The first was Kate Winslet's reaction (\"Make it stop! Make it stop!\") on seeing herself in 3D in Titanic.</p><p>Musically, the show suits its slot (8pm-midnight) with its easy-going classics, and Donny is certainly smooth enough to feel at home on the station. \"I beat Celine Dion as best singer in Las Vegas,\" he said of a recent award before playing some Dion. He talked about a Chinese fad for pillow fights to de-stress, then pretended to write \"Marie\" on a pillowcase (\"Hey, Marie, can I see you for a minute?\"). It's all very slickly done, but more chat from Donny would improve things. One unintended giggle: the commercial break after Puppy Love featured a rather neatly placed ad for dog food.</p><p><strong>Annie Nightingale's </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fcnhh\" title=\"Eternal Jukebox\"><strong>Eternal Jukebox</strong></a> (Radio 2), a one-off show for Easter Monday, was a far livelier affair, crackling with fidgety energy. \"Hello, hi, hey!\" said Nightingale after the opening track: Killer Queen. From there, she explained, the idea was that each track would spark a connection from \"the jukebox in my head\". The result was a meander through beautiful music – Prefab Spout, This Mortal Coil, Ian Dury, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley – yoked together with much style and verve by Nightingale. It was a huge treat for those of us who grew up listening to her Sunday night show, but who aren't majorly drawn to the grime and dubstep she plays on Radio 1.

          "headline": "Fox News hits back at 'bitter' Newt Gingrich over claims of campaign bias",
          "body": "<p>Fox News has attacked the struggling Republican presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, after an outburst in which he blamed the network for the failure of his campaign and claimed it was biased in favour of Mitt Romney.</p><p>The channel, where Gingrich had a contract before hitting the campaign trail, dismissed the accusations and claimed his criticism of the network was motivated by a desire for a job at rival CNN.</p><p>Gingrich's outspoken criticism of Fox came at a meeting in Delaware on Wednesday with Tea Party activists.<br /><a href=\" http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/04/12/gingrich_unloads_on_fox_news_in_private_meeting___113818.html\"><br />According to the RealClearPolitics website</a>, which was given access to the meeting, Gingrich said: \"I think Fox has been for Romney all the way through. In our experience, Callista and I both believe CNN is less biased than Fox this year.</p><p>\"We are more likely to get neutral coverage out of CNN than we are of Fox, and we're more likely to get distortion out of Fox. That's just a fact.\"</p><p>Fox hit back in a strongly personal attack. In a statement provided to the Guardian, it said: \"This is nothing other than Newt auditioning for a windfall of a gig at CNN – that's the kind of man he is. Not to mention that he's still bitter about the fact that we terminated his contributor contract.\"</p><p>While Gingrich has chosen to remain in the Republican race after the exit of Rick Santorum on Tuesday, he has won only two states so far and is trailing well behind Romney. He is also struggling financially, having accumulated huge debts during the campaign and suffered the indignity of seeing a $500 cheque to the Utah Republican party bounce.</p><p>Gingrich is campaigning this week in Delaware, one of several states where he hopes he can benefit from Santorum's departure.</p><p>At the Delaware meeting, he said he was working on the assumption that Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, Fox's parent company, had thrown his support behind Romney.</p><p>\"I assume it's because Murdoch at some point  said, 'I want Romney', and so 'fair and balanced' became 'Romney'. And there's no question that Fox had a lot to do with stopping my campaign because such a high percentage of our base watches Fox.\"</p><p>Fox, led by Roger Ailes, has been the main media forum for the Republican candidates. Fox insists it has been fair and balanced. In the initial stages of the primary and caucus season, it even seemed to be more hostile toward Romney than the other candidates. But by March, Santorum was complaining, on Fox, about bias.</p><p>Santorum said Romney enjoyed a huge advantage in terms of money, organisation and media coverage. \"He's had Fox News shilling for him every day,\" Santorum said.</p><p>Gingrich is to attend the White House correspondents' dinner at the end of the month, but as a guest of CNN, not Fox. He insisted he was largely indifferent to the views of journalists: \"They know I don't care about their opinions. I don't go to their cocktail parties. I don't go to their Christmas parties. The only press events I go to are interesting dinners when the wife insists on it, so we're going to go to the White House correspondents' dinner because she wants to. And we're actually going to go to CNN's table, not Fox.\"</p><p>He expressed disappointment that former colleagues Fox, with whom he had a contract until he officially joined the Republican race, had apparently written him off last summer.</p><p>Gingrich enjoyed massive media coverage when he won the South Carolina primary in January, but interest dipped after he failed to win Florida the same month. Since then, coverage has gradually evaporated, with no print journalists any longer attached full-time to coverage of his campaign. </p><p>In the meeting in Delaware, according to the RealClearPolitics report, he expanded his criticism of the media beyond Fox, in particular columnist George Will, whom he accused of personal jealousy.</p><p>\"In the case of Will, I was on [George] Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning with him, and it was kind of a 'You're not allowed to run for office – I mean, if you could run for office, why am I not running for office?' \" Gingrich said. \"And it's almost like they were personally offended. You know, 'This can't be real', and 'How can this guy go do that?'</p><p>\"I got that reaction from Will a few years back about writing a book, because I'm supposed to be a politician. He's supposed to be the writer. Well, I've now written 24 books, and 13 of them are New York Times bestsellers. I mean, there's a morning when George ought to just get over it.\"</p><p>As well as criticising the media, Gingrich attacked the Republican party, describing it as \"inarticulate\". He added: \"The Republican party is a managerial party that doesn't like to fight, doesn't like to read books.\"</p><p>He described Delaware as his best chance of a win on April 24.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Newt+Gingrich&k=Fox+News&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=US+elections+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Fox+News+hits+back+at+%27bitter%27+Newt+Gingrich+over+claims+of+campaign+bias+Article+1730661&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Newt+Gingrich%2CFox+News%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CCNN%2CMedia%2CRupert+Murdoch+%28Media%29%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CNews+Corporation+%28Media%29%2CTea+Party+movement%2CDelaware+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730661&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/12/newt-gingrich-complains-fox-news|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|2a61694f2a539a691a43c4cacc299ed8e88df40c -->",

          "body": "<p>The Metropolitan police chief has been summoned to parliament to give evidence about the growing racism scandal in the force, which has resulted in a string of inquiries involving almost 20 officers.</p><p>Bernard Hogan-Howe will be cross-examined by MPs on Tuesday about the mounting claims of prejudiced behaviour which have so far included reports of racially-motivated abuse, assaults and bullying over the last year.</p><p>The Met has now referred 10 cases involving alleged racism to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p><p>Eight police officers and one civilian member of staff have been suspended while a further three have been placed on restricted duties. Six of the police officers currently under investigation over alleged racism are from the Olympic borough of Newham.</p><p>The controversy is one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/06/metropolitan-police-race-row\" title=\"\">first major challenges</a> to face Hogan-Howe since he became commissioner in September. He is known to have been concerned about the impact on the police's reputation from serious allegations about a force which, 13 years ago, was branded institutionally racist by the Macpherson inquiry which was set up after the death of Stephen Lawrence.</p><p>The latest row began two weeks after the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse\" title=\"\">published a recording</a> in which one constable, PC Alex MacFarlane, can be heard racially abusing a suspect. MacFarlane has been suspended.</p><p>Four days later, and after a series of further disclosures, Hogan-Howe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/03/met-police-commissioner-report-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">urged his staff</a> to report inappropriate behaviour by colleagues, saying he was \"shocked\" by the revelations and adding: \"I will not stand for any racism or racists.\"</p><p>The decision to refer eight new cases to the IPCC was taken after an internal \"review\" – and amid growing public concern over the claims of racist language and abuse of black suspects.</p><p>Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the committee, said: \"This is an opportunity to ask the commissioner about the steps he has taken to drive out racism from the Met and to restore confidence in our police service. I welcome the decision taken by the Metropolitan Police to have these incidents investigated thoroughly, and the commissioner's strong words to the force about tackling racism within it. However, these strong words must be backed up with action. It is imperative that there is zero tolerance to racism within the police.\"</p><p>He added: \"Members of the committee have expressed their concerns about the most recent allegations of racism that have surfaced in the last two weeks. We hope the commissioner will be able to update the committee on the action that he has taken.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Metropolitan+police&k=Bernard+Hogan-Howe&k=London&k=Police&k=UK+news&k=Independent+Police+Complaints+Commission\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Met+police+chief+to+face+MPs+over+racism+scandal+Article+1730601&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Metropolitan+police%2CBernard+Hogan-Howe%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CPolice+and+policing%2CUK+news%2CIPCC+%28Independent+Police+Complaints+Commission%29%2CPolitics%2CRace+issues+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+Lewis&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730601&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/12/met-police-chief-mps-racism-scandal|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|b773008c39ae3ba3fbe643ba5f7c0c1f2e469df9 -->",

          "body": "<h2>THE COM IS ON</h2><p>And so to Anfield, where Liverpool's owners have bolted the stable door at the half-past eleventh hour just after the horse boarded that ship that sailed. Yep, after signing exactly 0.4 good players in his time at Liverpool, director of football Damien Comolli has been ushered to the door marked \"Do one\" and been given a big boot in the derriere. Despite wearing clever glasses, Comolli failed to spot that five good games for Newcastle didn't make Andy Carroll worth £35m; a few good crosses for Villa didn't make Stewart Downing Steve Guppy; and being fat didn't make Charlie Adam Matt Le Tissier. Oh, and Jordan Henderson.</p><p></p><p>Jordan Henderson.</p><p></p><p>Still, although some of Comolli's signings were a bit Sebastian Coates, it's harsh to blame the whole thing on him. Because while some his ideas were a bit Doni, nobody made John W Henry write out those transfer cheques. \"Everyone who has come into the club since Damien has been here was of my choice.

          "trailText": "<p><strong>Ask Jack:</strong> Michael Stevens would like advice on ripping CDs once so that he never has to do it again</p>",
          "headline": "Converting audio CDs into digital files",
          "body": "<p><em>You wrote in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2011/may/06/ask-jack-scanner-photographs\">another column</a>: 'My preferred strategy for scanning things (or ripping CDs), is to do the job so well that it never has to be done again.' Please could you share your thoughts on the best way to do this?</em><br /><strong>Michael Stevens</strong><br /><br />Converting or \"ripping\" an audio CD into a digital file is a time-consuming process, and there are at least two sensible options. The first is to make a perfect copy using a lossless system such as <a href=\"http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html\">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec). The second is to make a copy that is so good that you will never be able to hear the difference. I chose the second option, and encoded tracks in 320kbps MP3.</p><p>FLAC captures all the information in the recording, but it has two significant disadvantages: it produces large files, and not all portable music players can handle it. (Unfortunately, both Apple and Microsoft have their own lossless formats.) The MP3 codec, by contrast, delivers smaller files that almost every device – PC, phone, MP3 player, CD player etc – can play. It's the closest thing we have to a universal music format.</p><p>I could have used a lower bit rate than 320kbps (actually VBR: variable bit rate), and I can't reliably hear the difference between lossless and 196kbps MP3 files. However, using a higher bit rate should mean that when I buy better equipment -– such as a high-end MP3 player – it won't expose problems that were masked before. As you may have found, a good quality hi-fi stack and studio monitors can reveal flaws in music files that are inaudible when using a mainstream MP3 player with headphones or earbuds. This applies to CDs as well.</p><p>I could also have used a lower bit rate with the AAC file format, because it is more efficient than MP3. AAC makes a real difference at low bit rates, especially below 128kbps, but it doesn't make any practical difference at 256kbps and higher bit rates. I decided against AAC because it was far less widely supported than MP3, because there are several versions of AAC, and because I noticed most people like me were using MP3. (If a lot of people have the same problem, someone will produce a fix.)</p><p>When I wrote a feature about this, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/apr/12/newmedia.guardianweeklytechnologysection1\">Finding the music format of the future</a>, way back in 2007, I was bullish about AAC. Apple had just decided to offer unprotected 256kbps AAC files alongside its DRM-protected 128kbps AAC files, which I wouldn't use even if they were free. However, AAC has not made the sort of progress I expected, and I haven't regretted choosing MP3.</p><p>So, what's the best way to rip your files? This topic has been debated in considerable depth for at least two decades by people who are much more qualified than I am, so I decided to adopt what many experts considered the best approach. That was to rip CDs using Exact Audio Copy (EAC) software and the open source LAME, following one of the guides at the Hydrogen Audio website: <a href=\"http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=EAC_and_Lame\">EAC and LAME</a>. (The name stands recursively for Lame Aint an MP3 Encoder.)</p><p>I was interested to find that the results sounded better to someone who doesn't have a clue what a file format is, and has zero interest in the topic. I had shown my wife how to rip her own (classical) CDs on a Mac laptop using the iTunes defaults and left her to it: job done. A few days later, she got me to rerip them using my system because she wasn't happy with the sound quality.</p><p>Hydrogen Audio has quite a few <a href=\" http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=\"Category:Guides\"\">Guides</a>, including nine that use EAC. But if you decide to use <a href=\"http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=CDex_and_FLAC\">CDex and FLAC</a>, for example, there's a guide for that.</p><p>Hard drive sizes have grown over the past half dozen years, so we now have 750GB and 1TB drives where we used to have 120GB or 150GB drives. This means the extra size of FLAC files – which can be roughly half the size of the original WAV files – is less of an issue. For comparison, a 24-bit FLAC version of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (1973) takes up 239MB whereas my 320kbps MP3 version takes up 71MB. </p><p>You may find lossless files take up too much space, but it depends how many CDs you want to rip.</p><p>Although not every device will play FLAC, you can use these files to produce MP3, AAC, WMA or other lossy formats for mobile devices. The lossless rip becomes the master copy of the CD, so you never have to rip it again. If you need 320kbps MP3 files for a good quality MP3 player and/or 128kbps versions for a mobile phone, you can make them whenever you like.</p><p>This is not the same as \"transcoding\" between different lossy formats, such as MP3 or WMA and AAC. That leads to a loss in quality, and is always a bad idea.</p><p>I didn't rip things to FLAC, back in the day, and I'm not entirely sure I'd do it now. But if you don't have one or two decades of music files or want to make a fresh start, it's certainly worth considering.</p><p>Also, if we are ever going to move to a system that provides better-than-CD quality, FLAC is by far the most popular format. <a href=\"http://www.linnrecords.com/catalogue.aspx?format=studio\">Linn Records</a> sells 24-bit studio master recordings in FLAC format, and Apple Corps and EMI released a limited edition of The Beatles back catalogue in 24-bit FLAC and 320kbps MP3 on an Apple-shaped USB stick.</p><p>The problem with FLAC files is that Apple iPods won't play them. </p><p>This isn't a practical problem at the moment: they consume so much space, you probably wouldn't want to play FLAC files on a mobile device. However, people who are solidly in the iPod/iPhone/iTunes camp should consider using ALAC, Apple's Lossless Audio Codec, instead. Most iPods with recent firmware can play ALAC files, it's used in Airtunes, and Apple has now made the format open source. Lossless is lossless so ALAC files should sound identical to FLAC files (as long as you have <a href=\"http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=52057\">iTunes' Soundcheck switched off during playback</a>). It's really a matter of convenience.</p><p>Of course, Macs can play FLAC files, and Mac users can convert FLAC (and other) files into other formats using, for example, the open source <a href=\"http://sbooth.org/Max/\">Max</a>. If you are going to transcode audio files for mobile use, it doesn't matter whether you convert them from ALAC or FLAC.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Technology&k=Digital+music+and+audio&k=Digital+rights+management&k=Software&k=Computing\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Converting+audio+CDs+into+digital+files+%7C+Ask+Jack+Article+1730545&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Technology%2CDigital+music+and+audio+%28Technology%29%2CDRM+%28Technology%29%2CSoftware+%28Technology%29%2CComputing+%28Technology%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jack+Schofield&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730545&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/askjack/2012/apr/12/ask-jack-digital-audio|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|8025530a487654864cc76bbfb12d95d5686bced5 -->",

          "body": "<p>Police and victim support groups have welcomed moves by the Scottish government to make criminals who assault police officers pay to help fund their recuperation.</p><p>The Scottish justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, announced the initiative, one of the first of its kind in the world, during a visit to a police treatment centre in Auchterarder, Perthshire, which is part funded by contributions from officers' salaries.</p><p>In the last year there were 4,899 convictions for assaults on police officers in the Scottish courts. The new proposal would form part of the forthcoming victims and witnesses bill.</p><p>Ministers are also considering levying a victims' surcharge on criminals, on top of existing compensation orders, to create a fund that would provide help to all victims of crime. MacAskill said: \"The police treatment centres put right the damage done by criminal assaults largely with money raised by donations from the victims. This is the reverse of fair. Instead it is right to expect criminals who assault police to contribute to payment for this treatment. We believe proceeds from penalties should be paid into a fund for officers.</p><p>\"This is a win-win situation which will result in restitution for offenders and recuperation for victims of crime.\"</p><p>At the moment, anyone convicted of assaulting a police officer in the line of duty faces a fine, imprisonment, a community payback order or a compensation order. Under the new plan, another option would be for anyone convicted of such an assault to pay cash to good causes through a restitution order.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Police&k=Scotland&k=Crime&k=UK+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Criminals+who+assault+Scottish+police+to+be+forced+to+pay+for+their+treatment+Article+1730533&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Police+and+policing%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CCrime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CUK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Kirsty+Scott&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730533&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/12/criminals-assault-police-pay-treatment|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|5547564bb0b9e989eff53fbaa516bd32bcd361cb -->",

          "headline": "Black mathematicians: the kind of problems they wish didn't need solving",
          "body": "<p>John Derbyshire, a columnist for the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/295514/parting-ways-rich-lowry\" title=\"\">National Review</a>, wrote an <a href=\"http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/#axzz1rI2sQ2I7\" title=\"\">essay</a> last week implying that black people were intellectually inferior to white people: \"Only one out of six blacks is smarter than the average white.\" Derbyshire pulled these figures from a region near his large intestine.</p><p>One of Derbyshire's claims, however, is true: that there are no black winners of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal\" title=\"\">Fields medal</a>, the \"Nobel prize of mathematics\". According to Derbyshire, this is \"civilisationally consequential\". Derbyshire implies that the absence of a black winner means that black people are incapable of genius. In reality, black mathematicians face career-retarding racism that white Fields medallists never encounter. Three stories will suffice to make this point.</p><p>The first involves Saunders Mac Lane, one of the most influential algebraists of the last century. He co-authored, with Garrett Birkhoff, a text that enthralled me as a first-year undergraduate. I first encountered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_%28order%29\" title=\"\">lattice theory</a>, which for a long time I loved more than anything in life, in that book. In 1951, Mac Lane was president of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). Vanderbilt University hosted an MAA conference, and three black mathematicians wished to attend the conference's banquet. They were barred and <a href=\"http://sections.maa.org/southeastern/maase/section/minority.pdf\" title=\"\">Mac Lane refused to take a stand</a>: Vanderbilt University was in racially segregated Tennessee, and he did not want to offend his hosts.</p><p>The second story involves one of the few black mathematicians whom white mathematicians acknowledge as great – or, I should say, \"black American mathematicians\", since obviously <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid\" title=\"\">Euclid</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Life\" title=\"\">Eratosthenes</a> and other African mathematicians outshone Europe's brightest stars for millennia. His name was David Blackwell. I first met Blackwell in 1995, in the common room of Berkeley's maths department, one of the few times two black people had ever been in the room. Blackwell obtained his PhD in mathematics when he was only 22.</p><p>While he had a fellowship to work at the Institute for Advanced Study, the American home of Einstein and the other-worldly logician <a href=\"http://www.ostina.org/content/view/1155/510/\" title=\"\">Kurt Gödel</a>, nearby <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/education/17blackwell.html\" title=\"\">Princeton University refused to allow Blackwell</a> to attend lectures because he was black. Although he later became the first black member of the National Academy of Sciences (with a colleague saying, \"he would come into a field that had been well studied and find something really new that was remarkable\"), the University of California at Berkeley's maths department would not hire Blackwell on account of his race (a European later asked Blackwell to join the statistics department).</p><p>My third story is not that in 2002, after I wrote an article about Confederate remembrance, supporters of the Ku Klux Klan <a href=\"http://www.wienerzeitung.at/themen_channel/wz_reflexionen/zeitgenossen/34836_Jonathan-Farley.html\" title=\"\">sent me death threats</a>, forcing me to leave my home and my permanent job at Vanderbilt University. Others, such as Barrett Brown <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/26/american-civil-war-usa\" title=\"\">in the Guardian</a> and  <a href=\"http://latticetheory.net/media/pdf/Hot_Fat_Clouded_Excerpt.pdf\" title=\"\">in his book Hot, Fat, and Clouded</a>, have recounted how little support I got from the university authorities during this ordeal.</p><p></p><p>The last tale is not either that, when I was a professor there, police at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology detained me on suspicion of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/07/dnaofthekkk\" title=\"\">being a bank robber</a>.</p><p></p><p>No, my final story is that, in 2009, I was an invited speaker at the Counterterrorism Research Lab (CRL), along with US president Barack Obama's soon-to-be <a href=\"http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Om_SDU/Fakulteterne/Teknik/Diverse/CTRWorkshop.pdf\" title=\"\">cybersecurity tsar</a>, Howard Schmidt. At one point, a fellow American brought up the civil war, and said – angrily – that the pro-black-slavery Confederacy had the right to secede. I objected as politely as I could. The man exploded, firing off a chain of expletives in front of the 80-person audience. I was blamed for his outburst, and a job offer that had been previously discussed disappeared (it had happened before, when prospective employers withdrew offers after hearing about the Klan attacks). Along the same lines, a senior officer of the <a href=\"http://latticetheory.net/media/pdf/Personal_Reflections_on_Beauty_and_Terror_Page_388.pdf\" title=\"\">National Academies</a> ceased communication with me when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/nov/17/highereducation.uk\" title=\"\">he saw my essay</a> in the Guardian about racism.</p><p></p><p>Before I was 30, I had solved decades-old problems posed by the world-renowned <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2004/aandh-0519.html\" title=\"\">Richard Stanley</a> at MIT. At 32, the Klan attack sidetracked me. I probably never would have won, but one must be under 40 to win a Fields, and I have not had time to focus on Fields medal-worthy pursuits. Other black people fared likewise.</p><p></p><p>Losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income pales besides <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57401619-504083/author-of-stand-your-ground-law-george-zimmerman-should-probably-be-arrested-for-killing-trayvon-martin/\" title=\"\">being shot for Skittles</a>, so I do not complain. Instead, I let Harvard's Stephen Jay Gould reply to Derbyshire: \"Few tragedies can be more extensive than the stunting of life, few injustices deeper than the denial of an opportunity to strive or even to hope, by a limit imposed from without, but falsely identified as lying within.\" What gives me hope is that race relations are not what they were in 2002. The National Review fired Derbyshire. White people helped my career – specifically Birkhoff's student George Markowsky and Austria's Günter Pilz – but Blackwell refused to speak with me for even one minute: perhaps race is asymptotically approaching irrelevance.</p><p></p><p>At last.</p><p></p><p>• Professor Jonathan David Farley won the Harvard Foundation's Scientist of the Year medal in 2004</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Race+issues&k=Mathematics&k=World+news&k=United+States&k=Mathematics&k=Science\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Black+mathematicians%3A+the+kind+of+problems+they+wish+didn%27t+need+solving+%7C+Jonathan+Farley+Article+1729697&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=Race+issues+%28News%29%2CMathematics+%28Education+subject%29%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news%2CMathematics+%28science%29%2CScience%2CEducation&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jonathan+Farley&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1729697&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/12/black-mathematicians-john-derbyshire-fields-medal|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|51d8ade897edeff2f5f193873e9a57faaea332d8 -->",

          "headline": "Apple readies Flashback malware removal tool: but how big is the risk?",
          "body": "<p>Apple says it will develop a tool to remove the Flashback malware reckoned to have infected more than 600,000 Macintosh computers worldwide, most recently via a flaw in Oracle's Java software, following the worst attacks against the platform in the past decade.</p><p>But in a <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5244\">brief document posted on Wednesday</a>, the company did not offer any advice on how users could find out whether their machine was infected, nor – aside from updating their software – how they could protect themselves against infection.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Apple has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/apr/13/apple-flashback-java-malware-fix\">released the removal tool, for systems running Mac OSX 10.5 and 10.6.</a> Users of systems running earlier version are advised to disable Java.</p><p>(<strong>The security company <a href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002336.html\">F-Secure has instructions so that Mac users can discover whether they are infected</a>. <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/04/05/mac-flashback-trojan-check/\">Mashable also offers links to a pair of scripts</a> that will check Safari – though not other browsers – for infection.</strong>)</p><p>The first variants of Flashback appeared last September, masquerading as updates to Adobe's Flash player software. More recent variants exploited other flaws – notably in Java.</p><p>Once installed, the malware monitors network traffic to steal passwords and login details for various sites and systems, attempts to install itself as a root program able to access all users' files, and may also download other software from control servers silently. It could also organise infected machines into a botnet able to attack websites or, potentially, host fake websites and other unwanted content.</p><p>The latest version using the Java exploit meant users could be infected without taking any action via their browser if Java was enabled simply by navigating to an infected site. </p><p>A number of websites require Java to provide functionality. Although Java is not included in Mac OS X 10.7, aka Lion, which was released last year, anyone who had upgraded their system from an earlier version of the OS would have it, as would anyone who downloaded it to run programs such as Adobe's Creative Suite.</p><p>Crucially, Apple maintains its own version of Java, and had left the flaw unpatched for weeks: Oracle released a fix on 17 February, which was distributed to Windows users. </p><p>Brian Krebs, a security expert, <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/urgent-fix-for-zero-day-mac-java-flaw/\">comments</a> that Apple's lackadaisical (and often <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/\">plain puzzling</a>) response to patching dangerous security holes perpetuates the harmful myth that Mac users don't need to be concerned about malware attacks.</p><p>Krebs says: \"If you don't need Java, remove it from your system, whether you are a Mac or Windows user.\"</p><p>The extent of the outbreak makes the Flashback infection, which was first detected at the end of March by the Russian security firm Dr Web, by far the largest ever to hit the Mac OSX platform. In relative terms, it is at least equivalent to the <a href=\"http://mtc.sri.com/Conficker/\">Conficker outbreak on Windows</a>, which affected millions of PCs – though only affecting less than 1% of the total installed base. </p><p>In the second half of 2011, Apple Macintosh sales passed 5% of the total PC market for the first time in more than a decade; the <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1981717\">latest figures from Gartner</a> say that in the US, it achieved 10% of personal computer sales in the first quarter of the year. That may have led malware writers to target the platform with renewed vigour.</p><p>Neither Flasback's authors nor their location has become clear. In May 2011, Russian hackers targeted <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/what-a-mac-malware-attack-looks-like/3269?tag=content;siu-containerr\">Mac OS X, which was hit by a wave of infections</a> driven by a Trojan program called MacDefender – often spread via infected images in Google's image search. But the combination of a software update from Apple, and a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/08/raid-reveals-evidence-of-chronopay-ties-to-macdefender-scareware.ars\">raid by Russian police</a> put paid to the short-lived attack.</p><p>Although a number of commentators forecast at the time of MacDefender that it was the beginning of a fresh wave of attacks against the Mac OS X platform, it didn't materalise. At the same time, companies including Microsoft have made renewed efforts to close down botnets and capture those behind aggressive malware.</p><p>John Welch, who administers several hundred Macs for the organisation where he works, discovered that a number of the machines were infected by forms of Flashback, although in many cases the installation failed; that in turn locked out users who tried to log onto the machines, because certain files that Flashback told the system to load were not present. (The organisation uses Sophos antivirus on its machines.</p><p>\"It seems that the programmers behind it simply found a better infection vector, and used it,\" Welch told the Guardian. \"I'm not *that* impressed with it, I've seen too many half-done attempts to infect a machine where the silly thing couldn't even install correctly, so I'm not sure it's really all that clever.\"</p><p>He thinks that the principal threat will continue to be from infected documents rather than the core OS – though, he says: \"... not because Mac OS X or UNIX are magically invulnerable. (There's a lot of magical thinking on this subject.) It's more because due to some well-intentioned, but poor decisions made by Microsoft decades ago, the path to infect Windows was an eight-lane highway vs the muddy goat trail that was Unix. However, if you move off the OS proper, it gets more common.\"</p><p>Most high-profile attacks in the past few years have come from infected files which use weaknesses in associated software: Adobe's PDF and Flash Player have become increasingly common targets on both the Windows and Mac platforms, while Microsoft's Office suite – of Word, Excel and Powerpoint – are also frequently targeted by hackers seeking to subvert systems. </p><p>\"If it runs code, it can be compromised and run malware,\" Welch notes. \"It's just a matter of how much brainpower and skill someone wants to put behind it. Given the kind of money malware is now generating, there is a lot of both involved.\"</p><p>But he does think Apple has been too slow to react. \"This is a problem for Apple, and one I hope goes away with [Steve] Jobs not running the company. He had some issues with communication. I think Apple needs to speed up its reaction to verified threats, and they need to stop treating everything like it's [as secret as] the next iPhone. Yes, some things do need a great deal of security, but patching a *Java security hole* is not one of them. I know it's easy to get into that 'MUST NEVER SAY ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S DONE' mentality, but this has burned Apple in the past. They've improved somewhat, but have a ways to go.\"</p><p>With Apple having made both Flash and Java optional installations on existing desktop systems, the \"attack surface\" for malware authors has lessened. Welch points out: \"Java is a useful tool that fixes certain problems better than other tools. It's no more necessary than any other language or runtime. </p><p>\"A huge percentage of malware attacks happen via email and websites, yet no one asks 'should we really be using email and browsing the web?' [The open source database] MySQL and [web scripting language] PHP are commonly attacked, and successfully; no one questions those tools, even though they are a common infection vector.</p><p>If Java is the best, or even an equally good tool for the job, I think one is silly to ignore it because 'it's an infection vector'. So is PDF. I don't see people advocating the end of PDF. Bagging on Java in this case is silly. I do like that Apple doesn't install it by default, which I think is a good idea. The need for it is not *common* over the entire population of computer users, so making it an optional install is not a bad idea at all.\"</p><p>Yet even with the latest infection, amounting to 1% of the estimated installed base of Macs, there aren't so far signs of a deluge of attacks against Macs. Between MacDefender in May of 2011, and Flashback between September and the present day, the amount of Mac-targeting malware remains remarkably low; while Graham Cluley of Sophos points out in \"<a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/10/03/mac-malware-history/\">a short history of Mac malware</a>\", the amount targeting the platform has trebled in the past three years – but that still only amounts to a couple of new attacks per year. And one piece of software identified as \"malware\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/jun/02/mac-spyware-removed-premieropinion\">from PremierOpinion</a>, is arguably no such thing, but a user-sanctioned tracking system for web use. </p><p>Sophos does offer <a href=\"http://www.sophos.com/freemacav\">free antivirus software for Mac users</a> – though it's not available through the App Store (because Apple limits what can be sold through it; apparently antivirus software isn't allowed.) Graham Lee, formerly of Sophos, also points out that antivirus apps <strong>sold through the App Store</strong> can't do real-time scanning, because they aren't allowed to install kernel extensions – which means that new infections can't be caught as they happen, but only retrospectively. (<strong>Note:</strong> apps not installed via the App Store can install kernel extensions, and so can do real-time scanning - as Sophos AV does. Apologies for not clarifying this initially.)</p><p>The question now is whether the attacks will get worse – or if malware authors have other targets they can more profitably focus on. Whereas even five years ago the options for malware authors were simple – write something to attack Windows machines, or Macs; the potential rewards were over 19 times greater for the former – now there are almost as many smartphones (where Android apps have become an attractive source of revenue for some, using \"Trojan diallers\" which silently dial expensive numbers or transmit sender-pays text messages) and, increasingly, websites which have credit card details, or phishing sites that can capture login details for PayPal or for webmail accounts – where the latter can then be used to send out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/aug/05/beware-hackers-take-over-gmail-account\">fake frantic messages claiming you've been mugged</a>, and asking for untraceable wire payments.</p><p>In short, Apple may actually have been fortunate enough to survive the riskiest time – when the desktop and laptop computer were the principal form for computing – as malware has moved to a cross-platform format in which phones, websites, databases and simple social engineering have become equally good methods for criminals to get access to personal and financial details. It doesn't though mean that the danger has passed. But while 600,000 machines infected is certainly a lot, it pales in comparison to the millions of credit cards compromised by the attack on Sony's PlayStation Network, or the <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/03/mastercard-visa-warn-of-processor-breach/\">more recent hack of a US payments processor</a>. </p><p>In short: have antivirus, but the bigger threats are probably outside your computer.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Apple&k=Malware&k=Data+and+computer+security&k=Technology&k=Computing&k=Internet\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Apple+readies+Flashback+malware+removal+tool%3A+but+how+big+is+the+risk%3F+Article+1730384&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Apple+%28Technology%29%2CMalware%2CData+and+computer+security+%28safeguarding+computers+and+data+from+criminals%29%2CTechnology%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CInternet%2CSoftware+%28Technology%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730384&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/12/apple-flashback-malware-tool-risks|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|43dd9580dc2ff484294fdb147b5180e500075265 -->",

          "headline": "Cycle stunt team launches competition to find new female member",
          "body": "<p>Scotland's cycle stunt team, <a href=\"http://www.mb7.com/theclan/\" title=\"\">The Clan</a>, have launched a competition to find a new member to join them on this summer's tour of events. The winning rider must be skilled, committed, fearless and, most importantly of all, female.</p><p></p><p>It's the second year in a row that The Clan, the only UK stunt cycling team to feature female riders, has run a competition to find a new female member. Last year, they had six entrants. This year, with more than a week still to go before the deadline, they already have 10 in the running for the £5,000 prize; a sign, say the organisers, of a growing interest in the sport, and cycling in general, among girls and women.</p><p></p><p>Since they formed in 2008 – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2011/feb/20/danny-macaskill-bike-tricks\" title=\"\">Danny MacAskill</a> was a founder member – The Clan have insisted on having female members for the majority of their shows, relying initially on recommendations from friends and acquaintances of the six-strong team.</p><p></p><p>The Clan manager, Iain Withers, says:</p><p><blockquote>\"It's important to have diversity in our team and especially to ensure a female rider is present to show all the girls out there riding is not just for boys. \"It comes from the vibe of our show, trying to convince people that cycling is cool and fun and exciting for everyone. We have employed female riders since year one.  We were going round schools for Cycling Scotland and there was a lot of research that made it quite clear that if girls are going to get into cycling they need female role models to look up to.  That's what started it off.<br /><br />\"We were a little bit daunted to go and find a female rider because it's such a male dominated area. We didn't know if there was anyone out there who would be willing and capable but we have been really lucky. There have been six girls who have now done our shows and really the lesson has been that the talent is out there but it is just hidden away This year we have already got 10 really strong entries, quite a diverse range of talent from BMX to mountain biking. It's very promising.\"<br /></blockquote></p><p></p><p>The group runs shows at national sports events and community galas across Scotland in May and June. This year, for the first time, they'll be holding a women's weekend for all competition entrants in early May so that they can train and practice together on custom-built ramps and in a foam pit designed to allow riders to crash without hurting themselves.</p><p></p><p>Age, says Withers, should be no barrier.</p><p></p><p>\"Last year, we had a very strong entry from a mountain biker who was 15 at the time. She can't do it this year because she has exams but she's a really talented rider. Our first rider, Lynne Aitchison, who has since moved to Canada, is in her mid-30s. You can be any age. If we get some granny flying through the air that would be good stuff.\"</p><p></p><p>Speaking from Whistler in British Columbia, Aitchison says The Clan's insistence on featuring female riders is crucial for promoting the sport as widely as possible.</p><p></p><p>\"Having a female member of The Clan has been a really good thing as far as getting the message across to young girls that it's not just about boys,\" she says. \"When we went round schools the girls thought I was the bee's knees because I was a girl and I was doing all the tricks as well.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison only got into cycling in her late 20s and was in her 30s when she joined The Clan.</p><p></p><p>\"I did martial arts for a long time but I got a bit sick of doing sports inside. I had a bunch of male friends who mountain biked and I thought I'd try it out and I was hooked. I found I kind of excelled at jumping. I did my first back flip when I was 31.</p><p></p><p>\"It was a little intimidating for me at first to ride with a bunch of pretty highly skilled guys. I was 30 years old and I didn't get into biking until my late 20s. The guys in The Clan are really down to earth, really nice guys. They're all about riding rather than the kudos of being a bit of a stunt cyclist.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison has also set up <a href=\"http://www.airmaiden.com/\" title=\"\">Air Maiden</a> the annual women-only bike skills event at Glentress in the Tweed Valley. She had noticed that she was often the only female at the freeride skills park despite the fact that more women were getting into mountain biking.</p><p></p><p>\"It's a really comfortable environment,\" she says. \"There are no guys there to intimidate the women. It's really encouraging of them and it's grown so much that we're turning them away.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison will be back in Scotland for The Clan's women-only weekend in May and to offer support and encouragement to the competition winner. As much as she might have wanted to be involved, there was no chance of her being able to enter the competition this year.</p><p></p><p>\"I have a seven-month old son and I'm pregnant with twins so I'm not going to be riding my bike for a while.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/environment&k=Cycling&k=Fitness&k=Life+and+style&k=Cycling&k=Sport&k=Scotland\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/environment/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/environment/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Cycle+stunt+team+launches+competition+to+find+new+female+member+%7C+Kirsty+Scott+Article+1730287&ch=Environment&c2=148491&c4=Cycling+%28Life+and+style%29%2CFitness+%28Life+and+style%29%2CLife+and+style%2CCycling+%28Sport%29%2CSport%2CScotland+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Kirsty+Scott&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730287&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: environment/bike-blog/2012/apr/12/the-clan-female-rider|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|fcf50889e6f322feaa5e4c926406679a5aaa7767 -->",

          "headline": "Mitt Romney enjoys some security as vice-presidential contenders shy away",
          "body": "<p>Florida senator Marco Rubio and Virginia governor Bob McDonnell have participated in the long-established ritual of ruling themselves out as running-mates for Mitt Romney, who on Wednesday enjoyed his first full day as undisputed Republican presidential candidate. </p><p>Rubio and McDonnell join a growing queue of Republicans who insist they do not want to be the Republican vice-presidential candidate – but they have to say that, concerned they would end up looking foolish if they express an interest and Romney fails to pick them.</p><p>McDonnell, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505267_162-57412286/mcdonnell-santorum-should-back-romney/\">interviewed on CBS on Wednesday</a>, said he was happy being governor of Virginia. \"I got the job held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry – governor of Virginia. Doesn't get any better than that,\" McDonnell said.</p><p>With Rick Santorum's departure from the race on Tuesday, speculation began in earnest over the last big vacancy of the 2012 campaign to be filled, even though Romney is unlikely to announce his choice for months. Learning from the mistakes of John McCain's team in 2008, Romney's team will ensure their choice, unlike Sarah Palin, will be thoroughly vetted.</p><p>Santorum has expressed interest in the post but his harsh criticism of Romney would be exploited by Democrats, repeatedly replayed in ads.\"I think Santorum probably is not going to be in line for the VP spot because it's just been too nasty and contentious,\" Bradley Blakeman, a politics professor at Georgetown University, <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Santorum-Blakeman-campaign-withdrawal/2012/04/10/id/435439\">told Newsmax</a>. \"I think that he certainly can serve in a Romney administration if they find the right place for him where he can be helpful.\"</p><p>Rubio is repeatedly cited as among the frontrunners because he is a Latino, a demographic group that Romney and other Republicans have alienated, and because he represents Florida, a swing state that could determine the outcome of the White House race. \"I'm not going to be the vice-president,\" Rubio said, a line he has been repeating since last summer.  </p><p>But if offered the post, it would be hard to resist a platform from which to launch a bid of his own for the presidency in 2016 or 2020.</p><p>Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, is another prospective vice-presidential candidate, with the advantage of not only being from a Latino background but a woman, a demographic group with which Romney struggles compared with Obama. Martinez, like Rubio, has ruled out the job. \"It's humbling but I'm not interested,\" she told the Associated Press. </p><p>Much of the speculation focuses on issues such as gender, geography or ethnic background, working on the assumption that these will help bring in voters on the margin. But recent political history shows that presidential candidates have tended to buck this received wisdom, spectacularly so in the case of McCain in picking a running-mate from Alaska, which has almost no impact on the presidential race, and a woman who alienated women in droves.</p><p>Conservative commentator George Will, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/romney-needs-a-heavy-hitter-as-his-vice-president/2012/04/06/gIQAB0sVzS_story.html\">writing in the Washington Post</a>, noted that since the second world war, 10 presidential candidates have failed to win the home state of their vice-presidential running mates. He argued instead in favour of two candidates experienced in budgetary issues and adminstration, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal or Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee.</p><p>\"So Romney's running-mate should have intellectual firepower, born of immersion in policy complexities, sufficient to refute Obama's meretricious claims and derelictions of duty. Here are two excellent choices,\" Will writes.<br />Both Jindal and Ryan have ruled out being Romney's running-mate, as have New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, and Ohio senator Rob Portman.</p><p>One of the few Republicans to publicly express an interest in the job is Herman Cain. Part of the reason may be that he, unlike others, have opted to say he would consider it is because he is a long shot, having been forced out of the Republican presidential race late last year amid allegations of sexual harassment.</p><p>Asked by Fox how he would react if approached by Romney's campaign team about the job, he said: \"I would say 'Let's talk'. It's not a slam-dunk.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+elections+2012&k=Mitt+Romney&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mitt+Romney+enjoys+some+security+as+vice-presidential+contenders+shy+away+Article+1730154&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1730154&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/11/mitt-romney-vice-presidential-prospects|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|6ec10db2821ba853392a3926ae71b2fec69275b9 -->",

          "headline": "Jack Tramiel obituary",
          "body": "<p>Jack Tramiel, who has died aged 83, will be remembered as the father of the Commodore 64, which dominated the home computer market of the 1980s. It shipped more than 20m units – an astonishing number at the time – and was often described as&nbsp;the bestselling computer of&nbsp;all time.</p><p>Unlike most of his competitors, Tramiel (pronounced Tra-mell) was not a technology geek. He was a jovial, cigar-smoking, balding and somewhat portly Jewish businessman known for hard bargaining and for the slogan: \"Business is war.\" He drove down costs, cut prices and marketed the hell out of whatever he was selling. He said he targeted \"the masses, not the&nbsp;classes\".</p><p>No one would have predicted Tramiel becoming, somewhat briefly, America's most successful computer tycoon. An&nbsp;only child, he was born, according to&nbsp;differing accounts, as Idek Tramielski or Jacek Trzmiel, in Lodz, Poland, which&nbsp;was occupied by the Nazis in&nbsp;1939. He was finally liberated from the Ahlem labour camp, near Hanover, by&nbsp;the US army in April 1945. His father did not survive.</p><p>The 18-year-old Tramiel married Helen Goldgrub, a Bergen-Belsen survivor, in 1947, then emigrated to&nbsp;the US. In 1948 he joined the&nbsp;US army, where he learned how to repair office equipment. On leaving in 1952, he used a&nbsp;$25,000 GI loan to set up a repair shop, Commodore Portable Typewriter, in the Bronx, New York. In 1955 he founded Commodore Business Machines, in Toronto, to import and sell typewriters, moving to California in&nbsp;1968.</p><p>Tramiel's lucky break came in the person of Chuck Peddle, lead designer at MOS Technology. Commodore had bought this small American chip manufacturer to supply parts for its pocket calculators. Peddle told him that computers were the future, and that MOS had developed the cheap 6502 microprocessor, which appeared later in the Apple II, Acorn BBC and other home computers. He let Peddle design the Commodore PET (personal electronic transactor) around the 6502, and in 1977 CBM entered the computer market.</p><p>The PET was followed by the limited but very cheap Vic-20, and in 1982 by the Commodore 64. This was marketed for its huge 64K of memory, though only 38K was free to the built-in Basic. The C64 used custom MOS Technology sound and graphics, so no rival was able to get anywhere near its $595 price. Tramiel duly started a price war, reducing it in stages to $199.</p><p>Commodore did $1bn worth of&nbsp;business in 1983, then Tramiel suddenly resigned after a dispute with the company chairman, the Canadian financier (and major shareholder) Irving Gould. He was not away for long. A few months later, he bought the ailing Atari consumer games business from Warner Brothers, and went head-to-head against Commodore in the old 8-bit and new 16-bit markets. However, he soon started to take a back seat, and his three sons took over the bulk of the work.</p><p>The main US computer companies were moving from the 6502 and its ilk to the 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 processor: Apple with the Macintosh, Commodore with the Amiga, and Tramiel's Atari with the 520ST, known as the Jackintosh. It delivered most of the capabilities of the Mac for a fraction of the price. However, IBM-compatible PCs were taking over the market, and Microsoft Windows dominated the 1990s. Commodore declared bankruptcy in 1994, with only Commodore UK surviving into 1995.</p><p>Atari tried to innovate with the Lynx colour handheld games console, the 64-bit Jaguar and the Atari Portfolio, the first PC-compatible palmtop. None took off. Tramiel sold up in 1996 and retired to Monte Sereno, California, with a&nbsp;palatial house and two Rolls-Royces.</p><p>Outside computing, Tramiel gave talks about the Holocaust at schools and universities, and he was a founding philanthropic supporter of the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/\" title=\"\">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> in&nbsp;Washington, DC. He never forgot.</p><p>Tramiel is survived by Helen, their three sons, Sam, Leonard and Garry, and&nbsp;five grandchildren.</p><p>• Jack Tramiel, businessman, born 13 December 1928; died 8 April 2012</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBvbsPNBIyk\" title=\"\">Commodore 64 – 25th Anniversary Celebration</a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9C8xbbaRRA\" title=\"\">Jack Tramiel, Commodore Computers founder, interviewed</a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Computing&k=Technology&k=United+States&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Jack+Tramiel+obituary+Article+1730107&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Computing+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Jack+Schofield&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1730107&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/11/jack-tramiel|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|13231b0d6606f271c55e5704f43df8d4e1f7b741 -->",

          "headline": "Prometheus preview footage: five things we learned",
          "body": "<p>It's T-50 until the release of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> and on Tuesday the great and the good (OK, film hacks from around Europe) were invited to London's Leicester Square to watch a teensy bit more footage from the movie.</p><p>The crowd were shown approximately five minutes of new material, including what may be the entirety of the opening scene in which archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her lover and colleague Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) uncover a pictogram that Shaw sees as confirmation that aliens visited Earth in pre-history and invited humans back to theirs. Next we were whisked straight off into space and the exploratory vehicle Prometheus. We are introduced to the crew, from push-up loving suit Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) to disgruntled staffer Fifield (Sean Harris). There's an on-ship briefing, a bit of truculent banter and the judicious use of technology which, it's fair to say, is far more sophisticated than that in the Nostromo, despite it taking to the skies decades later (in Alien time). From there the descent begins to planet LV223 and, one suspects, the trouble starts.</p><p>Back on Earth, we got the chance to pop a few questions in the direction of cast members Theron, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/michael-fassbender\" title=\"\">Michael Fassbender</a>  (who plays the ship's android, David) and Rapace. Oh, and Mother himself, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ridley-scott\" title=\"\">Ridley Scott</a>. With the film so highly anticipated and its relation to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/75860/alien\" title=\"\">Alien</a> series of movies <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/dec/23/prometheus-trailer-alien-ridley-scott\" title=\"\">still debated</a>, what did we learn from this little event?</p><p><strong>1)</strong> It's all about the \"space jockey\". The colloquial name for the creature uncovered by the crew of the Nostromo in the original Alien, the space jockey (James Cameron calls it \"the big dental patient\") is a carcass, its chest exploded in bits, probably by a xenomorph. In the Q+A, Scott said the \"who is the space jockey?\" question will be answered and that the film is \"the story of a pilot\".</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Elizabeth Shaw is the new Ripley. This may not surprise everyone – although it did one journalist, who asked Theron what it was like to follow in the footsteps of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/sigourney-weaver\" title=\"\">Sigourney Weaver</a> only to be told to redirect her question to Rapace instead. Shaw is the wide-eyed archaeologist who, in the UK trailer, discovers a crucial cave painting that leads to a trip into the stars. By the end of the movie, we're reliably informed, Shaw is transformed into a hardened, remorseless soldier. Whether that's a hardened, remorseless soldier with a weakness for ginger cats, remains to be seen.</p><p> <strong>3)</strong> Watch out for the Weyland Corporation. That's the company that funds Shaw's trip across the universe, and its CEO and founder is a nonagenarian called Peter (Guy Pearce in, it's fair to say, excessive prosthetics). Of course, anyone with even a passing association with the Alien movies will know that suits are not to be trusted. The footage showed a hologram of an apparently now deceased Weyland (that can happen during a transgalactic journey) publicly humiliating his charge, Vickers. This suggests they're still not to be touched with an electrified bargepole.</p><p><strong>4)</strong> There will be other Alien echoes. More than just a few, perhaps. While Scott says the links between Prometheus and the original film will only become clear \"in the final seven minutes\", it seems as though there will be a deliberate pairing of characters and events throughout. So for Shaw read Ripley, for Idris Elba's Janek read Tom Skerrit's Dallas (the scruffy but debonair captain) and there seems to be an expanded cast of disgruntled below-stairs workers too. Most intriguingly though, Scott hinted at there being an equivalent to the defining chestburst scene. When asked about the original, Scott said there will be a refiguring of some sorts in Prometheus; \"There will be an equivalent, but it will be private to Shaw,\" he said. The lucky girl.</p><p><strong>5)</strong> Fassbender might just steal the show. Everyone's favourite half-German plays David, the sole android on ship. Again, we know that in Alien Iain Holm's Ash sold the entire crew out. Will David do the same? That audience suspicion will seemingly be played on as, going by the footage, Fassbender plays David as an airy, affable butler figure, shuffling around the ship with the awkward grace of an arthritic ballet dancer. The character looks almost lovable, which would make for an even better doublecross. In London, Fassbender cited an intriguing mixture of influences for his role, ranging from the obvious, Blade Runner, to the unlikely, Dirk Bogarde's The Servant and Lawrence of Arabia, to the downright odd, in the shape of former Olympic diver Greg Louganis.</p><p>• This article was amended on Wednesday 11 April 2012. We originally said that Prometheus lands on planet LFE222, in fact the ship lands on LV223.

The gang used specialist tools to lever out bricks and make a 3ft by 2ft hole to squeeze through, before seizing an 18th-century jade bowl and a <a href=\"http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_21879.htm\" title=\"\">Dehua porcelain</a> sculpture, almost certainly to order. Overseas buyers with very deep pockets, including some in China where the artworks were originally created, have created a thriving market for such items.</p><p>The pieces were taken from the ground-floor Malcolm MacDonald gallery at 10.40pm last Thursday.</p><p>The university has been the victim of high-profile theft before, when its Shakespeare first folio was stolen in 1998 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/09/raymond-scott-stolen-shakespeare-first-folio\" title=\"\">later criminally obtained by local antiques dealer and eccentric Raymond Scott</a>.</p><p>The book was recovered, slightly damaged, and Scott was jailed. He was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/14/shakespeare-folio-dealer-dead-scott\" title=\"\">found dead in prison</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Police have arrested five people from the West Midlands for questioning about the theft of the Chinese pieces but have not yet recovered either of the stolen artefacts. Both date from the 18th-century period of the Qing dynasty, China's last ruling family.</p><p>The large green bowl carved with writhing dragons dates from 1769 and has a Chinese poem written inside, while the sculpture is of seven fairies in a boat, beautifully crafted in translucent porcelain with a creamy glaze and standing about 30cm (12in) high. The bowl was obtained in China by Sir Charles Hardinge, a diplomat in the early 20th century who was noted for his early admiration for Gandhi. Hardinge also collected pottery and precious stones.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Adrian Green of Durham police <a href=\"http://www.durham.police.uk/press/news.php?id=2178&amp;area=1&amp;station=3\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"It seems very clear that this was a well planned, highly organised break-in. They have spent around 40 minutes creating a hole in an outside wall and, when it has been big enough, they have entered the gallery and made straight for these two items.</p><p>\"I am sure this job has been planned for quite some time and I would think the artefacts have been stolen to order, for someone who has already identified a potential market.\"</p><p>One of the people arrested, a 27-year-old man from Walsall, was questioned at a police station in County Durham on suspicion of assisting an offender, and has been released on police bail until June. The other four, a 34-year-old woman and three men aged 56, 41 and 36, were released on bail until June after being questioned in Durham on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.</p><p>The museum's curator, Dr Craig Barclay, said after the theft: \"We are extremely upset to have fallen victim to such a serious crime. The two pieces are highly significant in that they are fine examples of artefacts from the Qing dynasty in the mediums of porcelain and hard stone.</p><p>\"We very much hope that police will be able to recover them and we urge anybody who may have any information about their whereabouts to contact the police immediately.\"</p><p>The museum was closed over Easter, usually a busy period, because of the theft.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Crime&k=Museums&k=Durham+University&k=Higher+education&k=Education&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Specialist+criminals+stole+%C2%A32m+Chinese+artefacts+from+university%2C+say+police+Article+1729666&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Crime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CMuseums+%28Culture%29%2CDurham+University%2CHigher+education+%28Universities+etc.%29%2CEducation%2CCulture%2CUK+news%2CSculpture+%28Art+and+design%29%2CArt+and+design&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Martin+Wainwright&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1729666&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/11/2m-chinese-artefacts-durham-university|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|f9baa335b0a51d02d4b33b1082b5ea75651e5378 -->",

You can use the free version of the app to flash ClockworkMod Recovery on your device, reboot into recovery, install ROMs, or manage backups.</p></blockquote><p> This was flagged to us on Twitter as indicating that Cyanogenmod will \"soon be mainstream\". Our response: 99.9x% of Android users will never, ever mod their phones. They wouldn't even understand that extract.</p><h2><a href=\"http://blogs.smartmoney.com/advice/2012/04/10/with-instagram-facebook-gets-holy-grail-of-data/\">With Instagram, Facebook gets 'holy grail' of data - real-time advice &gt;&gt; SmartMoney</a></h2><blockquote><p>Snap a digital photo, and the file typically includes embedded information on where and when it was taken. Facebook says Instagram will remain a standalone app separate from the social networking site, but the acquisition could make it easier for marketers, advertisers and the apps and companies one \"likes\" to access that kind of photo information, says Deborah Mitchell, executive director for the Center of Brand and Product Management at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p></blockquote><p> Could be worth anywhere from $50 to $5,000 per user, apparently, because it says where you are (if you turn on location capture) and what you're interested in. Value-enhancing for Facebook if so.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/88bbbe56-7e8b-11e1-b7e7-00144feab49a.html#axzz1rcNWbNE4\">Investors demand change at ailing UK tech companies &gt;&gt; FT.com</a></h2><p>Intriguing - and unusual - viewpoint on small UK tech businesses. </p><blockquote><p>Jon Moulton, the private equity investor who bought Clarity at the end of last year, says that every few years the largest of the small-cap technology investors become restless and start to shop around their portfolios to private equity.</p><p> Private equity firms are in turn often keen to snap up these struggling businesses in the hope of being able to turn them around with radical management changes.</p><p> \"A lot of UK technology companies are really stable, cash-generating businesses and are only in a loss because of poor managers,\" says Mr Moulton.</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://securosis.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-security-smug-mac-user\">The myth of the security-smug Mac user &gt;&gt; Securosis Blog</a></h2><p>Rich Mogull: </p><blockquote><p>This is anecdotal, and I don't have survey numbers to back it up, but I've been probably the most prominent writer on Mac security for the past 5 years, and talk to a ton of people in person and over email.

All three Wi-Fi-only tablets are running Google's Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system; they are aluminum-encased, have Gorilla Glass displays, come with a five-megapixel rear camera and a two-megapixel front-facing camera, and include new Nvidia TegraTM 3 processors.</p><p> The Excite 7.7 also has an AMOLED display, a micro-USB port and a micro-SD card slot; while the Excite 10 has an LED-backlit display, micro-USB and micro-HDMI ports, and a full-sized SD card slot. At 1.32 pounds, the new 10-inch weighs just slightly less than Toshiba's last tablet.</p></blockquote><p> Great specifications. Gartner's prediction: iPads (no AMOLED, no built-in micro-SD or HDMI ports) will outsell Android tablets 2:1 in 2012.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2012/04/09/poll-people-like-google-more-than-apple-or-facebook-with-chart-and-full-results\">Poll: People like Google more than Apple or Facebook [with chart and full results] &gt;&gt; DWMedia</a></h2><p>Appears to be a statistically rigorous poll: </p><blockquote><p>In addition to very broad popularity, Google and Apple share vast exposure. Just 10% of Americans haven't formed a basic opinion of Google (rising to 29% of less tech-savvy seniors), and 14% have no opinion of Apple and Facebook alike.

          "body": "<p>Barack Obama embarked on a full day of election campaigning in Florida, a key swing state, hammering Mitt Romney and the Republicans over their support for tax breaks for millionaires.</p><p>The Obama re-election campaign had treated Romney as the likely nominee for months, apart from an occasional wobble as Rick Santorum scored surprise wins. But with Santorum out of the race Tuesday, Obama knows with certainty who his opponent will be in February.</p><p>Obama targeted Romney in a speech at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton in which he highlighted the so-called \"Buffett rule\": that millionaires and billionaires should not be paying lower tax rates than working-class Americans. The rule is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett.</p><p>Although Romney has wealth estimated at around $200m, he paid a tax rate of only 13.9% in 2010, less than many working-class Americans.</p><p>Congress is scheduled to vote on the \"Buffett rule\" on Monday, but it is opposed by Republicans and has no chance of passing. The proposed legislation would mean that millionaires would pay at least the same percentage in taxes as working-class families.</p><p>\"It's time for us to choose which direction we want to go in as a country,\" Obama said, rehearsing what is shaping up as a major general election theme. \"Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans like me, or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates – people who don't need them and never asked for them? Or do we want to keep investing in things that will grow our economy and keep us secure? That's the choice.\"</p><p>He dismissed the idea that prosperity would trickle down from a wealthy few: it has always come from a strong and growing working-class, he said.</p><p>The White House press spokesman, Jay Carney, acknowledged Tuesday that Senate approval for the \"Buffett rule\" was \"an uphill battle\", though he added that constituents could put pressure on Republican members of Congress.</p><p>Republicans argue that even if millionaires and billionaires paid more, the impact on the deficit would be minimal. The White House says the tax rise would be worth $47bn over 10 years.</p><p>The White House presented the speech as official business, but it was basically a campaign speech, buttressed at either end by fundraising events. Three fundraising events were expected to raise about $2m.</p><p>The Obama campaign wants to portray the Republicans as the party of the wealthy and the president as the champion of the middle classes.<br />Republicans counter that the tax issue is a diversion and the Obama administration should be focused on jobs and the economy, which they claim will be the main interest of voters in November.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Barack+Obama&k=Florida&k=Warren+Buffett&k=Business&k=US+politics&k=US+elections+2012\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Obama+targets+millionaires+and+Romney+in+speech+at+Florida+university+Article+1729568&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Barack+Obama+%28News%29%2CFlorida+%28News%29%2CWarren+Buffett%2CBusiness%2CUS+politics%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+Congress%2CUS+taxation+%28News%29%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729568&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/10/obama-millionaire-tax-breaks-romney|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|5a7b5322a7d97dd71c2bd1553d2372dc62d0a3c8 -->",

Even with Santorum out of the race, Gingrich's campaign collapsed last month when, portraying himself as a southern candidate, he failed to win either Mississippi or Alabama.</p><p>He has since only been going through the motions, with donations having dried up.  </p><p>In a statement Tuesday, he praised Santorum for having fought a spirited campaign. He added: \"I am committed to staying in this race all the way to Tampa so that the conservative movement has a real choice.</p><p>\"I humbly ask Senator Santorum's supporters to visit newt.org to review my conservative record and join us as we bring these values to Tampa. We know well that only a conservative can protect life, defend the constitution, restore jobs and growth and return to a balanced budget.\"</p><p>In an interview with Fox on Sunday, Gingrich described Romney as \"far and away the most likely Republican nominee\".  </p><p>When he ceased campaigning in any meaningful sense, Gingrich said he hoped that there might still be a showdown if Romney fell short of the 1,144 majority of delegates needed in Tampa. But he admitted on Sunday that if that failed to happen, he would fall in behind Romney in the campaign against Obama.</p><p>Last month Gingrich was much more bullish about his prospects and dismissive of Romney's status as frontrunner. He predicted that Romney would fail to secure the 1,144 delegates, that the decision would be brokered at the convention and that Romney was not much of a frontrunner, having done poorly in the Mississippi and Louisiana primaries.</p><p>Jay Bookman, a columnist on the Atlanta Constitution-Journal, <a href=\"http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2012/03/29/the-gingrich-political-career-now-at-an-end/\">wrote recently</a>: \"He [Gingrich] has no money and in fact his campaign is deeply in debt. He lacks the resources to travel, let alone buy campaign ads, and the press has abandoned him, raising the age-old question: if a man utters pearls of profound wisdom, and no-one is there to hear him, did he really utter them at all?

          "body": "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for those who are watching season five of Mad Men on Sky Atlantic. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode four</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/03/mad-men-season-five-episode-three\" title=\"\">Paul MacInnes's episode three blog</a></p><h2>Mystery Date<br /></h2><p>A busy week, but let's start with Sally Draper and <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/grandma-pauline\" title=\"\">Grandma Pauline</a>. It wasn't the central narrative in this episode, and it certainly wasn't the most dramatic (I guess throttling an ex-lover to death claims that prize), but it was a most interesting coming together of characters driven by some wonderful acting, especially on the part of 11-year-old Kiernan Shipka.</p><p>The setup has been prefigured. Grandma Pauline has been looming in the shadows of the haunted mansion since last season; strict, sceptical and, let's face it, no oil painting, she is Betty's nemesis. This week however, Betty is in Buffalo. Sally is left at home and Granny is in charge. The encounter starts off combative and ends up trusting, but the way in which it develops sheds further light on how Sally is no mummy's girl.</p><p>We first see Sally in this episode complaining to her father about Pauline's overbearing behaviour. She does so assertively and with the odd snide aside \"[She] wears so much perfume\". So far so Betty. Next Sally is confronted by Pauline in ogre mode, slapping her hands for attempting to read the newspaper and snapping 'Some things are not for children\". The next assault occurs as Sally's view of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsQpTbQ9Uo\" title=\"\">Mystery Date</a> (will someone spare the young from premature sexualisation!) is disturbed by Pauline's not so discreet discussion of the Chicago nurse murders. Conversation eventually turns to what we know is underlying all this tension, Pauline's disdain for Betty's parenting. She tells Sally that she would benefit from having some discipline in her life. Sally bridles. Pauline goes further, recalling a piece of casual paternal violence:</p><p>Pauline: He woke up and said; \"that's for nothing, so look out.\"</p><p>Sally: \"That's not very nice.\"</p><p>Pauline: \"No, but it was valuable advice.\"</p><p>The look on Sally's face as she hears this is the highlight of the hour. It's shock and fear, obviously, but it's also intrigue – in what kind of world might such a thing happen? – and then a final flash of what looks like calculation, as if the girl is working out whether such advice might actually be useful.</p><p>Now there's the characteristic whiff of feminine Mad Men self-loathing in that exchange, but still. By the end of the hour Pauline has formed a bond with Sally so great that they can get doped up on sleeping tablets. Along the way Pauline reveals herself to be a forthright woman of the world, and Sally someone willing to pay attention. Pauline, it turns out, makes demands of Sally, but she also treats her with respect. Sally responds positively to this. It will be interesting to see where the two go from here.</p><h2>Goodbye to Greg</h2><p>He came, he looked ripped, he left forever. The collapse of Joan's tangled marriage with Greg Harris was quick and, as was to be expected, unpleasant. As with his original enlisting, Greg did not consult Joan over his decision to stay in Vietnam for another year. The approbation of his peers (20 men look up to him, at last) mattered more than that of his wife. Joan's shock was as real as her determination to be the good wife during his shore leave, but you can't help but think; good riddance to bad, bad rubbish. What's more, the whole paternity thing now gets a degree less thorny.</p><h2>The Joy of Ginzo</h2><p>Michael Ginsberg, mouthy genius. That appears to be the size of things after the new hire wowed a prospective shoe, sorry, footwear client with a double pitch that drilled straight into the female id. Or so all the men in the room thought anyway.</p><p>In his second pitch, the \"too dark\" one, we see Draper-esque psychological conjuring, the difference being that Mike apparently \"gets\" women. Cinderella is being pursued down a dark alley, but yet \"she wants to be caught\". Her pursuer is not attractive but still seductive (perhaps a bit like our Mike?). It's his pursuit that has a power over Cinderella, that and the fact he's found her missing slipper.</p><p>The pitch is snapped up right away, a bollocking from Don follows shortly afterwards. The pretext is insubordination, taking the meeting in an unexpected direction. The subtext is obsolescence, Don raging at the younger colleague with the fresh new ideas. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/24/mad-men-matthew-weiner\" title=\"\">Matthew Weiner</a> has talked about this broader idea, the fear of becoming outmoded, and Don's reaction seems to play into that. For my money, I think the relationship between the two will prove to be more subtle than a straight-up oedipal conflict. Hey, they just might learn something from each other.</p><h2>Don's dream</h2><p>Sorry, but I didn't dig on this. Don is consigned to bed with a fever and a cough that, if this were a TV movie, would turn out to be the early stages of lung cancer. Instead it's a device with which the show can explore Don's commitment or otherwise to his new life of monogamy. That and chuck a bit of raunch in.</p><p>Probing Don's sexual morals is an entirely legitimate area for exploration and, one might say, central to Mad Men as a whole. To do it in his sleep, however, just seems like a cop out. Is it entirely impossible for an encounter with an assertive ex-lover to have happened during waking hours? It would have required a more nuanced resolution than either denial or death by strangulation, but I think that would have been more in keeping with the show. As it was, however, I felt we learned nothing but got fed some eye candy and eye-bulging violence as a substitute.</p><h2>This week's other notes</h2><p>Top bantz between Roger and Peggy. Is Roger now officially being played for laughs?</p><p>I like Stan Rizzo. Even when he's wearing pantyhose like some kind of mugger.</p><p>I also like Joyce Ramsay. Her nicknames are great (Paggasus!). This week it was her turn to wear the bad check jacket.</p><h2>Time stamps</h2><p>Another disappointing element to the hour was the way in which background events were shoved so heavily to the foreground. Particularly the repeated exposition regarding the killing of eight student nurses from South Chicago Community Hospital by one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Speck\" title=\"\">Richard Speck</a>. The murders caused panic and wild speculation (about Speck's genetic make up among other things) but are now largely forgotten. Which may explain the exposition, but didn't stop it from feeling a bit heavy.</p><p>\"I think this will get on the cover rather than the riots\", says Joyce Ramsay while doling out Speck photos to the SCDP youngsters (interestingly, Megan included). She goes on to say that \"there's been five riots already this summer\" and we learn from Dawn that there are more, localised incidents which might not get reported, never mind appear on the cover of Time. The summer of 1966 does not match the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Riots\" title=\"\">Watts riots</a> of the previous summer or the summer of 1968 in intensity, but it shows that this strain of civil disturbance was neither going away nor being heeded by the white ruling class.</p><p>These two incidents are, of course, brought together smartly for just one brief moment as Peggy confuses Dawn's very real fear of being attacked in her neighbourhood with the panic over Speck. That Peggy then follows it up by accusing her (with a solitary gaze at a handbag) of being a potential thief makes matters worse.</p><p>\"From July 8 to August 19, 1966 over 35,000 airline workers across the nation employed by five airlines went on strike.\" – I've pasted that straight from Wikipedia because this plot point was so dull that only Pete Campbell could get interested in it.</p><h2>Culture club</h2><p>\"I was discovered. Like Esther Blodgett\" – Peggy compares herself to Judy Garland in A Star is Born. Which must make the dipsomaniac James Mason character...</p><p>Mystery Date. I'm sure Sally's rapture at the TV ad might have had elements of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/oct/06/mad-men-season-four-episode-five\">Illya Kuryakin</a> about it, but she might also have wanted to get her hands on the <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7314/mystery-date\">Milton Bradley board game</a> where \"Depending on how the doorknob is rotated, a different guy will 'appear'.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio&k=Mad+Men&k=Television&k=Drama&k=Historical+drama&k=US+television&k=Television+%26+radio\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mad+Men%3A+season+five%2C+episode+four+Article+1729485&ch=Television+%26amp%3B+radio&c2=148491&c4=Mad+Men+%28TV%29%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CDrama+%28TV+genre%29%2CHistorical+drama+%28TV+genre%29%2CUS+television+%28TV+and+radio%29%2CTelevision+and+radio+TV%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+MacInnes&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729485&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/10/mad-men-season-five-episode-four|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|1baca2d861122b4b51c9095aa7762045e741928b -->",

          "headline": "Rick Santorum bows to the inevitable and quits Republican presidential race",
          "body": "<p>Mitt Romney looks certain to be the Republican candidate facing Barack Obama in the fight for the White House in November after his last serious rival, Rick Santorum, bowed to the inevitable and quit the race for their party's nomination. </p><p>After a bruising campaign that began in Iowa on January 3, Santorum declared at a press conference in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania: \"The race is over for me.\" The decision leaves Romney with a clear route to the Republican nomination at the party convention in August.</p><p>Flanked by his family and close aides, Santorum said: \"We made the decision to get into this race at our kitchen table against all the odds, and we made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race is over for me – and we will suspend our campaign effective today – we're not done fighting,\" adding he would continue to battle have his socially conservative views heard.</p><p>Romney, freed from the distraction of having to campaign in the Republican race, will now be able to focus his energy and funds on the battle with Obama. He must now hope that the deep GOP divisions exposed in the primaries and caucuses can be bridged, and that the Republican party will unite behind him.</p><p>The former Massachusetts governor can depend on the party millionaires who regard Obama as too left-wing to pile in behind him, ready to fund one of the biggest negative ad campaigns in US political history. The question is whether the party grassroots – who regard Romney as too moderate – will join the rally behind him.</p><p>Romney has much ground to make up. Obama's re-election campaign team, based in Chicago, has been building networks of supporters in the swing states, and Obama himself has been out on the campaign trail for months. As Santorum was delivering his resignation speech, Obama was taking to the stage at an event in Florida.</p><p>The president, in a speech at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, hammered the Republicans over their protection of tax breaks for millionaires, which Obama intends to make a key election issue – one he hopes will define the difference between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"It's time for us to choose which direction we want to go in as a country,\" Obama said. \"Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans like me, or Warren Buffett, or Bill Gates – people who don't need them and never asked for them?  Or do we want to keep investing in things that will grow our economy and keep us secure?  That's the choice.\"</p><p>He did not mention Romney or his wealth directly, but the implication was clear.</p><p>Obama held fundraising events on either side of the speech, bringing in an estimated $1.9m.</p><p>Polls show Obama with significant leads over Romney, particularly among women. The outcome could be determined by whether the economy continues to recover over the summer and autumn.</p><p>Santorum, in his Gettysburg remarks, did not offer support or endorsement of Romney by name. </p><p>In a statement minutes after Santorum finished his speech, Romney was gracious: \"Senator Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran. He has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation.\"</p><p>Romney consistently outspent Santorum and other rivals in advertising, by margins of four-to-one or higher. Romney's campaign, and the nominally independent political action committee that supports it, are estimated to have spent more than $30m.   </p><p>Official figures for March are due out later this week but Time magazine, based on returns submitted to the end of February, estimated that the Romney campaign spent $17.14 per voter compared with $2.54 for Santorum.</p><p>Santorum has been a stubborn opponent, winning a string of states, including Iowa, with his under-funded campaign contrasting with Romney's millions.  </p><p>He won 11 states, including victories in Colorado and Minnesota in February and Alabama and Mississippi in March. His departure brings to an end a race that produced lots of ups and downs, with Republicans replacing one another as party favourite with on a frequent basis dating back to the Ames straw poll in Iowa in August.   </p><p>Congresswoman Michele Bachmann gave way as party favourite to Texas governor Rick Perry, who in turn was replaced by pizza mogul Herman Cain and then former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This race was as improbable as any race you will see for president,\" Santorum told reporters in Gettysburg. He was the most socially conservative of the candidates, his anti-gay and anti-abortion views winning a core of supporters among Christian evangelicals.</p><p>Santorum said he was suspending his campaign rather than quitting, a technicality that allows him to continue fundraising to clear his campaign debts.   </p><p>Gingrich is still theoretically in the Republican race, but has all but given up campaigning, and admitted weeks ago that Romney would win. The outsider, Congressman Ron Paul, said he will remain in the race, fighting his own idiosyncratic campaign but is so far behind he stands no chance of catching Romney.</p><p>Paul congraluted Santorum on a \"spirited campaign\" and insisted he planned to press the fight all the way to the party convention in Florida in August.</p><p>Santorum cited as one of his reasons for leaving the race his daughter Bella, who is seriously ill and who spent the weekend in hospital before being discharged on Monday.   </p><p>But his exit was also an acknowledgement of the brutal arithmetic. When he failed to win the Illinios primary last month, Romney's lead became insurmountable. Santorum refused at the time to quit, hoping to win Pennsylvania in a fortnight, but polls showed his initial advantage disappearing, and it would have been a major embarrassment for him to have lost his home state.</p><p>There will be speculation that Romney might pick him as his vice-presidential running mate, or even as a member of his cabinet, though that would be awkward given the comments Santorum has made about him, including the charge that Romney has no core principles.</p><p>Santorum may instead treat the 2012 race as a practice run for 2016, though he would need to widen his appeal beyond socially conservative Republicans.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Rick+Santorum&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=Republicans&k=US+elections+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rick+Santorum+bows+to+the+inevitable+and+quits+Republican+presidential+race+Article+1729552&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Rick+Santorum%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CWorld+news%2CBarack+Obama+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729552&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/10/rick-santorum-quits-republican-race|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|04faadabdacffc059bdd1c5104f04b131f159a6b -->",

          "headline": "Mental health treatment gets street smart",
          "body": "<p>Four years ago, Charlie Alcock was spat on, ignored, had pebbles thrown at her and was suspected of being an undercover police officer by the north London gang she was trying to strike up a conversation with by hanging around their fish and chip shop of choice.</p><p>The incongruity of a privately educated, academically high-achieving, white woman raised in rural Gloucestershire appearing from nowhere and saying she wanted their help was clearly not lost on the group of two dozen or so urban young men, who had  struggled to stay in school and spent most of their days smoking cannabis and getting into trouble. It took six months before one member of the group even asked her, \"in a not very polite way\", what she was doing there.</p><p>Alcock, an NHS psychologist who wanted to start up a social enterprise tackling the causes of youth crime, gave him the short version: that although there were services aimed at his group, they weren't working. \"And I think you know what works,\" she told him.</p><p>Over the next few months, the teenager became a go-between, conveying ideas between Alcock and his peers about what sort of a project they wanted to set up, eventually settling on music.</p><p>The music group was the genesis of <a href=\"http://www.musicandchange.com/\" title=\"\">Mac-UK</a>, the charity Alcock subsequently founded in 2008 in collaboration with the young people involved in gangs. It was a way to engage with them and build relationships in order to start working with them on mental health issues.</p><p>Alcock wanted to find new ways to address the link between mental health and youth offending. \"The group that was of great interest to me was young offenders, and the fact that one in three young people who offend have an unmet mental health need at the time of offence,\" she says.</p><p>Treatment or, as Alcock terms it, \"street therapy\" needed to be administered wherever young people would feel comfortable – whether in fish and chip shops or on park benches. It is a long haul. Alcock admits that \"even now there are young people we've known for three years and they are only just beginning to work with us\".</p><p>The Mac-UK programme works intensively for as long as two years with about 30 young \"severely deprived\" people aged between 16 and 25, often homeless. All have refused traditional offers of help. Street therapy is central to the project, with young people self-referring and deciding when, where and for how long they would like to meet.</p><p>Her insight into how she might better reach young offenders came while working on an \"alternative to incarceration\" project in New York during her clinical training. There, one young man told her that as a result of talking to psychologists like her, his cousin had been killed for \"snitching\".</p><p>\"Until you can find a way to work with us that's safe, you might as well go home because you're actually putting us at more risk than if you weren't here,\" she recalls him saying.</p><p>For people on the margins of society there's a distrust of public services – either because of a bad experience with the authorities or from fear of imprisonment, says Alcock. The only way to reach them was to become part of the furniture of their lives.</p><p>Alcock views gangs as enterprises whose goals needs fixing rather than as ventures that need to be disbanded. Gangs might be criminal in outlook but, she argues, they can be transformed into community organisations, responding to people's needs.</p><p>\"It's about what the group does. So the whole idea of Mac is that gradually the peer group begins to do something more pro-social, collectively. Rather than dealing drugs, carrying weapons, they're setting up a music project or whatever it might be,\" she says. The young people use their DJ skills to run the music sessions themselves, employed by Mac-UK.</p><p>From dealing with troubled teenagers Alcock can see that on the street there is an explosive mix of heavy skunk [cannabis] use, frightening levels of domestic violence growing up and clinical depression. Some youngsters speak of hearing voices, others admit self-harm.</p><p>\"This group have often grown up with lack of adult role models, found school particularly challenging, and you mix some of those risk factors with environments of real threat – which is what gangs create, and you add skunk as self-treatment, then it's no wonder that a lot of these young people do have issues with mental health,\" she explains.</p><p>To engage such disaffected and chaotic young people, the 16-strong Mac-UK team, which includes psychologists, youth workers and volunteers, seeks to win their trust by taking part in whatever group activity is taking place. \"So [if] there's a gym group, we have mental health workers on the treadmill – going quite slow,\" says Alcock.</p><p>Once a bond has been established, Mac-UK sessions with trained staff can occur anywhere. These \"might take place on buses, benches, stairwells. We might go with a young person to court – waiting for four hours to be seen by the judge is an amazing opportunity to do work,\" she says. \"The young people definitely trust me now [and] others in the team,\" she adds.</p><p>As well as providing mental health support to those who need it and improving their access to mainstream services, Mac-UK aims to reduce re-offending and get the young people into employment, education or training. Three-quarters of the first cohort moved into training, education or employment – albeit temporarily for some. Three of the young men on the music scheme have gone on to set up their own successful project – Mini Mac – which delivers music and mental health awareness into schools.</p><p>It is a persuasive pitch from an assertive 32-year-old social entrepreneur, bidding to solve some of society's most intractable problems. As Alcock says: \"Five per cent of young people cause 95% of youth crimes, and it's that 5% that we work with.\"</p><p>Her approach, which has been funded by the <a href=\"http://www.phf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Paul Hamlyn Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.camden.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Camden council</a>, is now being evaluated by the <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mental Health Foundation</a>. It is also being piloted in another area of north London with a plan to set up a further three projects in the capital in the next 18 months. The projects will be in partnership with staff from council and NHS services, who Mac-UK will take under its wing and introduce to the young people.</p><p>\"They're often young people who are homeless or have moved out of their family situation, so they're often in young persons' hostels or sleeping on friends' sofas, occasionally rough sleeping. In our experience, if one of this group was homeless it's going to be the local drug dealer that gives them a room. That is how it works,\" says&nbsp;Alcock.</p><p>Her Mac-UK model can be adapted at a local level, she says, because it is \"grown from the ground up\" by the young people that it seeks to help. She adds: \"I want it to become the status quo for working with this demographic.\"</p><h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2><p><strong>Age</strong> 32.</p><p><strong>Lives</strong> North-west London.</p><p><strong>Family</strong> Engaged.</p><p><strong>Education</strong> Cheltenham ladies college; Warwick University, sociology degree; Oxford Brookes University, psychology conversion; Salomons campus – Canterbury Christ Church University, PhD in clinical psychology, specialising in community psychology.</p><p><strong>Career</strong> 2008-present: chief executive, Mac-UK; 2007-08: clinical psychologist, Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust, assertive outreach team for adults with severe and enduring mental health issues.</p><p><strong>Public life</strong> Member of the independent advisory network for the Home Office's ending gang violence team.</p><p><strong>Interests</strong> Snow-boarding and crafts, including making cards, candles and bath bombs.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/society&k=Mental+health&k=Gangs&k=Communities&k=Young+people&k=Health&k=Society\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mental+health+treatment+gets+street+smart+Article+1728950&ch=Society&c2=148491&c4=Mental+health+%28Society%29%2CGangs+%28Society%29%2CCommunities+%28Society%29%2CYoung+people+%28Society%29%2CHealth+%28Society%29%2CSociety&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Raekha+Prasad&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1728950&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: society/2012/apr/10/mental-health-street-smart-charlie-alcock|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|bce3011e2235a5e69c7929af9df0c0af9bdcacd7 -->",

          "headline": "It's time for a register of interests for science academics",
          "body": "<p>A professor friend of mine was telling me recently how popular he was with his vice-chancellor. Not, he stressed, because of his respectable smattering of reasonably original papers in journals with quite short titles. Nor for his teaching, since he hardly did any. No. It was the money he raised.</p><p>This is a top table topic at present in academia, as Guardian science contributors have noted. \"Can basic research be saved from the tyranny of the profit motive?\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/23/scientists-basic-research-business\" title=\"\">asked, for example, Nature's Ananyo Bhattacharya in February</a>, lamenting the perennial cash crisis of blue skies.</p><p>But don't ask me how much my pal raised, or the paws from which he prised it. Although I know it was the usual tens and hundreds of grand from a balanced portfolio of industry, government and charity sources, common courtesy discouraged further inquiry. In truth, I don't care. But somebody might. In which case, tough luck on them.</p><p>Although triumphant in the common room over their front-of-the-plane funding, successful science academics (particularly in biosciences) are often as publicly transparent about the paymasters behind their publishing as chefs are about rats behind the fridge.</p><p>This isn't news. The evidence is overwhelming. You could build yourself a treehouse of printed worries. And even Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health, has called for compulsory online registers of researchers' interests as a condition of federal funding. \"The public may not always understand the intricacies of rigorous science,\" <a href=\"http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/303/23/2400\" title=\"\">he wrote two years ago</a>, \"but most individuals quickly grasp the concept of bias.\"</p><p>What came of his proposal? <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/08/new-us-conflict-of-interest-rule.html\" title=\"\">Pretty much zilch</a>. So, was there a storm in science media? Of course not. Though weeping like clockwork crocodiles over the murky side of mullah, science editors couldn't give a monkey's backside. Why would they? Why would, say, Nature fret over who picks up its authors' tabs, so long as it isn't its behemoth publisher, <a href=\"http://www.macmillan.com/\" title=\"\">MacMillan</a>?</p><p>As long as scientists get more money (which I think was Bhattacharya's point) and the idea doesn't get round that most science articles are advertising, the tobacco industry's dosh is the same colour as Marie Curie's. All it needs is a good scrub for opacity. More worrying to journal editors would be any dent in reader loyalty triggered by stirring public pressures to disclose.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563288/?tool=pubmed\" title=\"\">favourite paper</a> from seven years ago which opened a tiny window on all this. <a href=\"http://grovevetshighpeak.com/the-team\" title=\"\">Sue Mayer</a>, now an English Peak District vet, checked six months' worth of Nature reports on genetics and molecular biology against authors' patent interests filed elsewhere. It wasn't life's biggest study. She didn't find the Higgs Boson. But what she did find should make you wince.</p><p>Working with the <a href=\"http://www.genewatch.org/\" title=\"\">GeneWatch</a> group, she calculated that an astonishing two thirds of authors with a related patent claim hadn't felt moved to declare this in their papers. \"The research reported here,\" she concluded in the <a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/\" title=\"\">Journal of Medical Ethics</a>, \"indicates that failure to report competing financial interests in original research published in Nature is the norm, not the exception.\"</p><p>And what was the reaction to this dazzling snapshot? She tells me: \"They took not the slightest bit of notice.\"</p><p>Which brings me back to my pal the professor, or more particularly to his delighted vice-chancellor. With nobody but a public, perhaps to be swindled or maimed, with much stake in who's paying whom, I fear our best chance of disinfecting science with light must lie in academia itself.</p><p>Although the White House last year dumped on Collins's plan, the self-evident innovation would be for the institutions themselves to introduce compulsory registers. Some units already have them, in a haphazard kind of way, but every university should have a publicly searchable database of academics' external sources of money.</p><p>Competing commercial interests would then be readily checkable, saving labours such as Mayer's. This is obvious. And every kind of funder, from children's charities to GlaxoSmithKline, could be back-tracked for influence, year-on-year.</p><p>The gristle in the pasty, of course, is that academics run academia. And they're not exactly jostling to log their interests. That would be a step closer to league tables and sub-specialty beauty contests – in which those with enough stats might dread falling below the median, risking inquiries that manners surely forbid.</p><p>Academics also manage, however, and there's big bucks to be had there (and, for British men, that wondrous title \"Professor Sir\"). But for those males who wish to excel (while making their wives a Lady), my friend reckons the opportunity to use a register to fire people may be no less enticing than the dough.</p><p></p><p><em>Brian Deer's website is </em><a href=\"http://briandeer.com/\" title=\"\"><em>briandeer.com</em></a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/science&k=Science&k=Science&k=Education&k=Higher+education&k=Biosciences\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=It%27s+time+for+a+register+of+interests+for+science+academics+%7C+Brian+Deer+Article+1729265&ch=Science&c2=148491&c4=Science%2CScience+%28Education+subject%29%2CEducation%2CHigher+education+%28Universities+etc.%29%2CBiosciences+%28Education+subject%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Brian+Deer&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729265&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: science/2012/apr/10/register-of-interests-science-academics|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|9b5531ec35799c8b1280dee28a0c93a7bf589923 -->",

          "body": "<h2>Titanic Centre</h2><p>Titanic Belfast (<a href=\"http://www.titanicbelfast.com/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">titanicbelfast.com</a>, adults £13.50, children £6.75, families £34), housed in a new £97m building in the Titanic Quarter, tells the story of how the ship was built and launched in Belfast. The exhibition has nine interactive galleries – visitors can walk through the original Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard gates, take a six-minute Shipyard Ride through different parts of the ship, with the sounds of riveting and smells of metal burning, and see replicas of the first-, second- and third-class cabins. There's also a glass floor with video footage of the Titanic on the seabed.</p><p>Next door, the Titanic Slipways, where the ship and her sister ship Olympic were built, have been landscaped with lights, grass and decking to show the outlines of the actual ships. A few minutes away is Titanic's Dock and Pump-House (<a href=\"http://www.titanicsdock.com/\" title=\"\">titanicsdock.com</a>, tickets from £5 adults, £3 children, £12 families), where you can peer down into the 880ft graving dock where Titanic sat for her final fit out. The best way to explore the Titanic Quarter is to take a tour – a two-hour walking tour includes access to the Dock and Pump-House and also to the Harland and Wolff drawing offices (0754 648 9874,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.titanicwalk.com\" title=\"\">titanicwalk.com</a>, adults £12, children £5-£8, families £30).&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Titanica exhibition at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum in Cultra, east of the city, you can also hear audio recordings of stories told by the survivors, and there is an exhibition of some original artefacts that were recovered from the ship, including a porthole and soup tureen (<a href=\"http://www.nmni.com/uftm#TITANICa--The-Exhibition\" title=\"\">nmni.com</a>.from £6.50 per adult and £4 per child, £13-£18.50 families).</p><h2>The MAC</h2><p>On 22 April the MAC arts centre will open&nbsp;with a new play by Belfast-born playwright Owen McCafferty about the Titanic Inquiry. The script of the play, Titanic: Scenes From The British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry 1912, is based on survivors' testimony given at the inquiry in London. The hearing took 36 days and involved nearly 100 witnesses; this courtroom drama retells some of the human stories of bravery and frailty from the disaster. The Mac is in the buzzy St Anne's Square behind St Anne's Cathedral (see below). <br /><em>• 10 Exchange Street West, St Anne's Square,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://themaclive.com/whats-on/titanic/\" title=\"\"><em>themaclive.com</em></a><em>. Tickets available from 22, 23 and 24 April from £9.50</em></p><h2>Titanic themed pubs and restaurants</h2><p>As well as official events, the city's pubs and restaurants have also jumped on the Titanic bandwagon – with varying degrees of, er, taste. The Merchant Hotel (028-9023 4888, <a href=\"http://www.themerchanthotel.com/index.php/offers-and-events.html\" title=\"\">themerchanthotel.com</a>) has been transformed into a \"ship\", the RMS Merchant, for the month of April. The five-star hotel has nautical bunting and RMS Merchant flags and staff are dressed in nautical uniforms. Guests checking in for the Titanic Experience package will receive a boarding pass with their key card and can have a Gin and Titonic cocktail (oh, yes!) in the \"A-Deck bar\". There's also a nine-course tasting menu based on the flavours of 1912, including dishes such as cold asparagus truffle vinaigrette, poached oysters, champagne and orange sorbet, and turbot and lamb à la Francaise (£85 with recommended wines, £65 without).</p><p>Over at the five-star Culloden Hotel in Holywood, there's a special – wait for it – Sips Ahoy! Titanic Afternoon Tea similar to that served onboard to first-class passengers, with sandwiches, pastries, Harlequin biscuits and Titanic cupcakes (£22 per head, 028-9042 1066, <a href=\"http://www.hastingshotels.com/culloden-estate-and-spa.html\" title=\"\">hastingshotels.com</a>). Also in Holywood, Rayanne House is offering a Titanic banquet  of nine courses, with everything from champagne-laced asparagus to foie gras and truffle and cream of barley soup finished with Bushmills whiskey and cream (£69 per head, various dates, <a href=\"http://www.rayannehouse.com/TitanicMenu.aspx\" title=\"\">rayannehouse.com</a>).</p><h2>The Linen Hall Library</h2><p>Founded in 1788, the Linen Hall, formerly a linen warehouse, is Belfast's oldest library. Entry is free and the cafe is currently running an exhibition of work by Belfast-born artist Terry Bradley, which features striking paintings of the faces of men who worked in the dockyards in Belfast and Dublin 100 years ago. The library also has a small exhibition of Titanic memorabilia and posters on show until 30 April.</p><p>On 19 April, Dr John Welshman, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Titanic-Last-Night-Small-Town/dp/0199595577\" title=\"\">Titanic: The Last Night of a Small Town</a> (published last month), will give a talk about the stories of passengers and crew who survived (including the second officer, a first-class governess and a mother in third class) and what happened to them in the years afterwards. <br /><em>• 17 Donegall Square North, free,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.linenhall.com/programme.asp\" title=\"\"><em>linenhall.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p><h2>Land Of Giants at the Titanic Slipways</h2><p>Rehearsals are under way for this outdoor summer event which will tell the story of the many giants of Belfast and Northern Ireland – from Finn McCool (the legendary warrior who built the Giant's Causeway) and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver (said to have been inspired by Cavehill which overlooks the city) to the Titanic and Olympic ships and the landmark Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes, also known as Samson and Goliath. The locations have been landscaped and lit to mirror the shape of the two ships that were built there, and a special stage made of shipping containers will be constructed. The audience will stand, divided between the two slipways, and at each end a crane will lift aerial performances into the air. During the 45-minute show, which starts at dusk, there will also be a specially commissioned animated film projected onto the Titanic Belfast building behind the slipways, as well as circus, music and pyrotechnics.&nbsp;<br /><em>• 30 June 2012, doors open 9.30pm, £10 adults, £6 concessions, £28 families, Titanic Slipways Saturday 30th June 2012. </em><a href=\"http://www.landofgiants.info/\" title=\"\"><em>landofgiants.info</em></a><em>; tickets from&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.gotobelfast.com/whats-on/event/land-of-giants\" title=\"\"><em>gotobelfast.com</em></a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/travel&k=Belfast&k=Northern+Ireland&k=The+Titanic&k=United+Kingdom&k=Travel&k=Belfast\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/travel/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/travel/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=100+years+on%2C+The+Titanic+is+bigger+than+ever+in+Belfast++Article+1728929&ch=Travel&c2=148491&c4=Belfast+%28Travel%29%2CNorthern+Ireland+%28travel%29%2CTitanic+%28News%29%2CUnited+Kingdom+%28Travel%29%2CTravel%2CBelfast%2CUK+news%2CMuseums+%28Culture%29%2CCulture%2CFamily+holidays&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Yvonne+Gordon&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1728929&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: travel/2012/apr/10/titanic-events-100th-anniversary-belfast|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|9e6f3eef8d6d84083dc868d896fcc38e34294520 -->",

          "headline": "New wave of well-off Pakistani women drawn to conservative Islam",
          "body": "<p>All the women working in the information technology division of the Bank of Punjab's headquarters in the western Pakistani city of Lahore wear headscarves tightly wound around their cheeks and chin, framing their faces as they tap at their keyboards. A year or so ago not one covered their heads with the hijab.</p><p>\"I was the first,\" says 28-year-old Shumaila, as she waited with some impatience in the city's iStore for her new £800 Apple MacBook to be loaded with the software she had ordered.</p><p>\"I started reading the Qur'an properly and praying five times a day. No one made me wear the hijab. That would be impossible,\" she laughs brightly. \"I showed the way to the other girls at work.\"</p><p>They are not alone. Though there are no statistics and most evidence is anecdotal, a new wave of interest in more conservative strands of Islam among wealthier and better educated women in Pakistan appears clear.</p><p>It is part of a broader cultural and religious shift seen in the country over  decades but which observers say has accelerated in the past 10 years.</p><p>\"The other girls who were working with us left.\" Shumaila said. \"They found the new environment a bit unfriendly.\"</p><p>One indication of the trend is the growing proportion of women within the conservative religious political organisation Jamaat-e-Islami (JI). Syed Munawar Hassan, the leader of JI in Pakistan, said that women made up an increasing proportion of the organisation's 6 million members and 30,000 organisers. \"Our women's wing is doing very well,\" he said. \"They are some of our best organisers.\"</p><p>JI, like its counterparts elsewhere in the Islamic world, has traditionally recruited among the lower middle class, swollen in recent decades in Pakistan by rapid urbanisation and economic growth. But the new wave of devotion is now touching the elite in a new way. Al-Huda (The Guidance), an organisation set up in 1994 to spread a new and often rigorous piety among Pakistani women, has gained a foothold among the  upper reaches of society.</p><p>The group, which critics accuse of encouraging intolerant strands of Islam influenced by those practised in Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, has grown from an initial single small centre in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, to a presence in every city, and is expanding among the Pakistani diaspora abroad.</p><p>Members attend intensive courses in Qur'anic studies and Arabic and are directed to do social welfare work, too. Not all enjoy the experience of al-Huda, however.</p><p>\"I found it very limiting and rigid. But it is very popular among women from very wealthy families that are quite conservative. Recently there are a lot of young women coming to a very traditional Islam. There is a deep desire for learning,\" said Maha Jehangir, a 30-year-old consultant and former al-Huda member.</p><p>Jehangir, who lives in a large house in one of the most exclusive parts of Islamabad, said questions posed by the events of the past decade were particularly important for young women.</p><p>\"People who grew up within the war on terror are asking, what does it mean to be a Nato ally? Is India our worst enemy? We are bombarded by all this information and there is a deep need for answers. That leads to religious inquiry,\" Jehangir said.</p><p>Many found the answers in conservative strands of religious practice, she said.</p><p>Other influences that underpin the new piety among wealthy women include the experience of many Pakistanis who have spent time in the Gulf.</p><p>Amna, a 21-year-old business student whose father was a manager for a major firm in Saudi Arabia, said that it was wrong to think that women who were richer or more educated would inevitably be more secular.</p><p>\"Everything we learn comes from the Qur'an. Maths, computers, banking – the Qur'an contains everything,\" said Amna, who wears a Saudi-style full veil covering all but her eyes even at the all-female college in Islamabad where she studies.</p><p>However, if there is a demand for more rigorous, literalist strands of Islamic practice among wealthy and educated women, there is also an interest in more tolerant varieties.</p><p>In Lahore, the <a href=\"http://www.al-mawrid.org/\" title=\"\">al-Mawrid institute</a> is attracting more and more \"educated ladies, doctors, professors, housewives who do not know about Islam\", says Kaukab Shehzad, a 43-year-old teacher.</p><p>The institute, in the wealthy suburb of Model Town, was set up three years ago but had to move after receiving threats from radical scholars, she said. \"We read the Qur'an in detail but we discuss other religions too. We were attacked for saying that the niqab [Saudi-style veil] is not justified in the Qur'anic teachings and for arguing against their interpretation of the idea of jihad,\" she said.</p><p>Though solidarity with Muslim communities overseas is encouraged by many conservative practitioners, many of the new devout shun such a global vision and identity. Shumaila, the bank worker and Apple enthusiast, says she is not interested in events in the Middle East: \"We've enough going on here.\"</p><p>Jahangir, the former al-Huda member in Islamabad, recently spent two years studying in a religious school of the Deobandi branch of Islam, also followed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. A graduate of both Massachusetts and London Universities, she too said that political activism was of little interest: \"I don't try to make sense of the Taliban. I find [them] obscure and irrelevant.

          "headline": "Manchester United v QPR – as it happened",
          "body": "<!-- Block 1 --><p>Early arrivals were offered this snippet from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/07/dissent-manchester-united-sir-alex-ferguson\">Paul Wilson's match preview</a> to tide them over, and I see no good reason to take it away now. So here it is.</p><blockquote><p>Manchester United have won 10 of their past 11 league games and drawn the other, not only displaying the sort of precisely timed acceleration that defines champions but giving their rivals an object lesson in team unity and professional focus. While United have moved five points clear at the top of the Premier League, Manchester City have been one of the sides caught arguing among themselves, with disappointing results leading to signs of dissent on and off the pitch.</p><p>It could be argued that good results promote team harmony, and vice versa, though even in adversity, or the occasions such as Monday evening at Blackburn when the leaders had to wait 80 minutes for a breakthrough, squabbling among United players is rare.</p><p>\"I wouldn't allow it,\" Sir Alex Ferguson says, speaking with all the authority of a manager who has faced down internal criticism from Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and others in his time. Even those cases tended to happen away from the pitch, in television studios or books. United players conspicuously fight for each other on the pitch, they do not turn on each other.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>The teams are in! </strong>And they look very much like this:<br /><strong>Manchester United:</strong> De Gea, Rafael Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Valencia, Scholes, Carrick, Young, Rooney, Welbeck. <strong>Subs: </strong>Amos, Jones, Giggs, Park, Hernández, Cleverley, Pogba. <br /><strong>QPR:</strong> Kenny, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Hill, Taiwo, Diakite, Derry, Mackie, Taarabt, Buzsaky, Bothroyd. <strong>Subs: </strong>Cerny, Gabbidon, Campbell, Young, Smith, Wright-Phillips, Zamora. <br /><strong>Referee: </strong>Lee Mason.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.00pm:</span> <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/soundway-records/another-one-bites-the-dust-los\">Song of the day:</a> A good choice for this one should probably reflect Manchester United's potentially title-winning current form, and it might be a bonus if it came from South America, to emphasise the central role in that form played by their on-fire Ecuadorian winger Antonio Valencia. And so, from neighbouring Colombia, I offer you <em><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/soundway-records/another-one-bites-the-dust-los\">Otro Muerde El Polvo</a></em> by Los Miticos Del Ritmo, an instrumental cumbia cover of a tub-thumping English rock classic (of sorts). It's not even out yet, that's how on the button I am. Don't thank me.</p><p>If you do happen to like that, try <a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/Sinfonia+Agridulce/2GoCD0?src=5\">this</a>, a mariachi cover of a laid-back English indie classic. A couple of years old, but just excellent.</p><p>Anyway, shall we talk football?</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.16pm:</span> So Nani's much-trumpeted comeback from injury takes him only as far as the stands. Javier Hernández, who I thought had quite a poor game against Blackburn on Monday, is replaced by Danny Welbeck, with Ashley Young also coming into the side in polace of Phil Jones. QPR start Jay Bothroyd for the first time since January.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.19pm:</span> Mark Hughes explains that Joey Barton is out of the squad because he's on nine bookings and they don't want him suspended.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.26pm:</span> \"Well they're better choices for songs than the one I thought of when seeing the photo of the managers – Depeche Mode's Master and Servant,\" writes Gary Naylor, as the teams come out. \"I suspect there'll be a little of that songs S (if not M) meted out today at Old Trafford.\"</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.27pm:</span> \"That is quite a scary photo you have there,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst (picture repeated left, for those who turn up after I've changed the main one). \"Please tell me they weren't facing each other at the time. Although if they were, it is notable that Ferguson is looking unfaithfully over Hughes' left shoulder, possibly eyeing up his next dance partner.\"</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>1 min:</strong> Peeeeeeep! They're off!</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>2 mins:</strong> QPR haven't left their own half, and United have their first kind-of-chance, a free-kick after Clint Hill brought down Welbeck 20-odd yards out. Rooney and Young stand over it.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>3 mins:</strong> Rooney shoots, and the ball hits the head of Anton Ferdinand at the end of the wall and flies wide.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>5 mins:</strong> Another corner from Ashley Young; the keeper comes but gets nowhere near it. It's headed away. \"Do you suppose 1.19pm's Mark Hughes realises that, no matter how long he rests him, Joey Barton will still be on nine bookings next time he plays?\" asks Mac Milling. There's a yellow-card amnesty approaching, I believe.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>6 mins:</strong> And United's barrage continues. If this is QPR's gameplan it's a rubbish one. Another free-kick, another shot from Rooney and this one is on its way in until Paddy Kenny flies across his goal to turn it wide.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>8 mins: </strong>United have had 92% of possession in these first seven minutes. Another key question. \"We all know that footballers aren't allowed to get bevvied and turkied up at Christmas (and people say they have an easy life) but does anyone know if they're still allowed to gobble Easter Eggs today, or if club nutritionists and the like frown on such decadence?\" asks Ryan Dunne. I believe they are allowed an occasional Easter egg, so long as it is poached and not fried or scrambled.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>9 mins: </strong>QPR have just kicked the ball in United's half, several times. It ended with a decent crossing chance for Nedum Onuoha, which he rather fluffed.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>11 mins: </strong>Toph Taylor has had the time to look up what I couldn't, and provides the relevant paragraph of Premier League regulations concerning the yellow card amnesty:</p><blockquote><p><br />(iii) If a Player accumulates ten cautions in FTCM between the opening day of the Playing Season and the second Sunday of April in the same Season, he will be suspended automatically for a period covering:- Two First Team matches</p></blockquote><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>13 mins:</strong> Rooney touches the ball into the path of Welbeck, inside the penalty area, but it was a very pacy touch requiring perfect instant control, which Welbeck didn't quite pull off.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>14 mins: </strong><strong>PENALTY! RED CARD!</strong> Rooney passes the ball into the path of Ashley Young, running into the penalty area. He was two yards offside when the pass was made, and then dived over Shaun Derry's not-that-muscular challenge.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 1 QPR 0 (Rooney, 15 mins)</strong> Rooney shoots low and hard to the goalkeeper's right. Kenny goes the right way, but still can't touch it.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>16 mins: </strong>An abysmal decision by the referee's assistant not to give the offside, and a poor one by the referee to award the penalty, in my opinion.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Hill fouls Welbeck again – not much in it, to be fair. Ashley Young shoots into the wall. It's all about the goal difference now, surely. And about the FA charge Mark Hughes will get when he inevitably tells the lino how rubbish his decision was, using a television camera as an intermediary.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Young's every touch now getting booed by the travelling fans.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>21 mins:</strong> A QPR shot! Taarabt with it, a good 30 yards out, but it strikes Carrick's foot and flies over the bar.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>24 mins: MISS!</strong> Rooney tries to play in Valencia, gives the ball to Taiwo, takes it back again and then crosses to the near post, where Ashley Young meets the ball but heads across goal and wide.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>27 mins: </strong>\"It was offside, but its a penalty and red card instead,\" fumes Kiki, as Rooney's goalbound shot from Valencia's pass is well blocked. \"You gotta be ******* kidding me. **** the premiere league! **** the refs! Every week there's this kinda ********! PS Forward this to FA will ya.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>30 mins: </strong>United are probing gently in search of No2, inevitably focusing their attacks down the right wing. \"Can I just say, as a Red Manc of four decades' standing, that it's decisions like that which give all the ABUs and conspiracy theorists ammunition, isn't it?\" writes Greg Scully. \"Never a pen, and definitely not a red. And it doesn't look like we were gonna need the help, so it just sullies what should be an incredible achievement, in the event that we do lift title #20 this year.\"</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>32 mins: </strong>Taarabt gets into the penalty area, takes the ball round Rafael but then sees his shot blocked by the sliding Evans. Sky replay the penalty incident. It really is a horrific triple-whammy of abysmal decision-making. I think the only fair thing the Premier League can do in the circumstances is to allow Manchester City to start their game at Arsenal with a 1-0 lead.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>36 mins: </strong>Rooney shoots from 22 yards, and the ball was heading towards the top corner, if not at any great pace, before Kenny plucks it out of the air. In the last 10 minutes I've had emails from furious QPR fans, emails from embarrassed United fans, and emails from apoplectic neutrals. Here's the first in defence of the referee: \"The fact is without the offside call from the assistant he had to give the penalty and the red card,\" insists John. \"Derry did put his hand on Young, and even an exagerrated dive cannot save him. Lee Mason won't be happy with his assistant though.\" I think that's a generous interpretation. There may have been contact between the players, but contact alone does not make a foul – there has to be more than that.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>38 mins: </strong>Valencia crosses from the right, Welbeck at the far post heads over. \"Something must be done about diving,\" rages Malcolm. \"Surely there is a case for video evidence post match. Derry's card should be rescinded and Young banned for four games. The goal should be deducted from the final score and any points adjusted accordingly.\" I'm all in favour of video evidence being used post-match to punish clear cheating, but think that unless there are more camera angles out there this particular incident would, in cricketing parlance, go down as a \"referee's call\".</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>42 mins: </strong>\"Ashley Young is English. And English players get an easier ride compared to the foreign players,\" says Martin Tyler on Fox, according to Ali Kinnaird. I don't think he's wrong: I don't see why Young's reputation should be any better than that of, say, Suárez or before him Di Canio, who both seem to have been swiftly tagged by referees as divers and could scarcely buy a penalty thereafter.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>45 mins: </strong>United have been perfectly capable since that goal, working hard to win possession and working it well around the penalty area, but QPR have been equally industrious in denying them chances. \"That United goal if anything just delegitimises their championship,\" writes Liam Harris. \"They've had abysmal performances in all four other competitions they've been in, and now the 'myth' that they get 'the benefit of the doubt' from refs at Old Trafford emerges again. It's not great when you've got one team trying to buy their way to the title and the other trying to cheat their way, and Chelsea trying to do both but still failing.\"</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>45 mins:</strong> We'll have a single minute of stoppage time here. Scholes celebrates by thwacking a 30-yarder well wide.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>45+1 mins:</strong> Peeeeeep! It's half-time, and QPR fans greet the whistle with a lusty chorus of boos.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>Half-time:</strong> I'm going to draw a line under the penalty incident now. It's happened. We'll hear a lot more about it later, I'm sure. I plan to enjoy the second half as if it never happened. And I don't <em>really</em> think City should be allowed to start their game with a one-goal advantage (though I do think that life would be better if there was a way of reacting to such vital and clearly incorrect decisions that was a little more convincing and meaningful than just shrugging and saying that it evens itself out over a season).</p><p>United have played well, but as is often the case they looked more likely to score in those first 15 minutes, when they were totally dominant, than in the half-hour they played against 10 men. They've had nothing but two headed half-chances since, one from Young at the near post and one from Welbeck at the far, both from Valencia crosses.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Peeeeeeep! They're off! Again!</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>46 mins:</strong> United immediately on the attack again, and Rooney and Young both have shots blocked within a minute of the restart.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>47 mins:</strong> United have a goal disallowed! Valencia crosses low and hard, and Welbeck is probably a foot offside as he taps it in.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Ashley Young's lovely backheel plays Welbeck in, but his shot flies over the bar.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>54 mins:</strong> Rooney's low, hard drive from just outside the area is well held by Kenny.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>56 mins: </strong>Diakité's long-range shot skids wide, helped on its way by a deflection. QPR have had the best of the last couple of minutes. \"My problem with QPR is that you simply can't see them as a plucky underdog,\" writes Michael Hunt. \"They appear to the casual snap-judging football opinion-maker (Hi there!) to be a small club in comparison to their more illustrious opponents this season, and yet the owners and the ludicrous money spent on mediocrity means that they don't get any sympathy. You can't root for them to bring it back, even against United.\" Clearly QPR are the least loveable of the three promoted sides this season, and also, by happy coincidence, the least successful.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Down the other end, and another shot from distance, this by Scholes, flies wide. Talking of which. \"It seems to me that these days Scholes hardly ever heeds the exhortations of the crowd to SHOOOOOT! from distance,\" writes Ian Childs. \"Efforts from distance seem really rare from Scholes these days, as he almost always to elects to keep the ball moving. Does anyone have any stats on Scholes' long shooting since his return?\"</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Incredible save! Rafael bursts into the QPR penalty area and is found unmarked and entirely on his own by Scholes's excellent pass. A goal seems inevitable, but the shot clips off the keeper and thuds against the bar.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>61 mins:</strong> A lovely reverse pass by Rooney finds Welbeck steaming into the penalty area, but his first-time left-foot shot is poor and straight at Kenny, and his follow-up effort, hit while off-balance, is easily caught.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>63 mins:</strong> Ryan Giggs has replaced Ashley Young, and darn nearly gets his head on another Valencia cross in a certain-goalscoring position straight away.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>65 mins: </strong>This from @OptaJoe on Twitter at half-time: \"Michael Carrick (81) &amp; Paul Scholes (76) made 157 passes between them in the first half, 39 more than the whole QPR team.\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 2 QPR 0 (Scholes, 68 mins) </strong>Bad news for Ian Childs' credibility, as Scholes takes yet another shot from range. Teed up by Rafael, he sends the ball arrowing into the bottom left corner of the goal, from about 25 yards. No doubt about that one.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>71 mins: </strong>QPR substitutions: Tommy Smith and Shaun Wright-Phillips replace Adel Taarabt, who gifted United possession in the run-up to the second goal, and Samba Diakité.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>73 mins:</strong> United replace Scholes with Tom Cleverley, and bring Phil Jones on for Rafael, who had just been booked, apparently for falling over.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>77 mins: </strong>WOWEE! A patient United attack ends with Evra passing the ball inside to Carrick, whose shot from a good 40 yards thuds into the post. \"Given Ian Childs' delicious tempting of fate re: Scholes' long-range shooting, is there any chance he could write an email along the lines of 'Can anyone remember the last time Arsenal scored 14 goals in a game?'\" asks Greg Scully.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>80 mins: </strong>Another substitution: QPR bring DJ Campbell on for England's Jay Bothroyd.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>83 mins: </strong>QPR chief executive Phil Beard on Twitter: \"Difficult to take after watching numerous replays but Ashley Young could partner Tom Daley at the Olympics. #QPR\"</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Not much by way of tempo in this game now. United are controlling possession, the game is won, and QPR have their minds on Wednesday's match against Swansea. Cleverley has a shot deflected wide.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>88 mins: </strong>The teams from the Emirates, for those who are interested: <strong>Arsenal: </strong>Szczesny, Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Benayoun, van Persie. Subs: Fabianski, Andre Santos, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Djourou, Jenkinson, Chamakh. <strong>Man City: </strong>Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy, Touré Yaya, Barry, Milner, Aguero, Nasri, Balotelli. Subs: Pantilimon, Richards, Pizarro, Dzeko, Kolarov, Tevez, De Jong. <strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>90 mins:</strong> We'll have three minutes of stoppage time.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>90+2 mins:</strong> United keep possession for long enough for me to start writing that they'll play out the rest of the match in their own half, and then sweep forward. Cleverley curls a shot wide from the edge of the area.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> Peeeeeeep! It's all over. United open up an eight-point lead over Manchester City, for a couple of hours at the very least.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>Final thoughts: </strong>United were always likely to win this. Not just in prospect: they utterly dominated the opening exchanges. In all likelihood it made little difference to this match that the breakthrough came from a penalty that shouldn't have been given, involving a player who was offside, resulting in an extremely harsh red card. Had united thereafter swept 10-man QPR aside with a scintilating display of attacking greatness, it could almost have been forgotten. But that didn't happen, and it won't be. Lee Mason should be on the receiving end of a helluva rollicking at some point shortly, and his assistant will presumably be manning League Two touchlines with that bloke from Chelsea v Wigan for the remainder of the season.</p><p>Over, then, to Manchester City.

          "headline": "If only Holyrood appreciated woman",
          "body": "<p>Attempting to plot the exact time when the decline and fall of the Labour party in Scotland began is a difficult exercise. There are some who believe the party signed its own execution warrant simply by its enthusiasm for the devolution project. Donald Dewar's subsequent unholy inquisition in which he ensured that only the \"right sort\" would be deemed worthy of selection for the first diet of Holyrood has similarly had disastrous consequences for Labour. It meant that when the party ceded power to the SNP in 2007 there were depressingly few politicians of sufficient calibre to challenge what was a formidable array of talent and experience on the nationalist side.</p><p>Alex Salmond and his inner sanctum of acolytes and devotees has proved to be comfortable in possession. The principle members of his cabinet have survived more or less intact after five years of power. In the decade before they took Holyrood, there were few occasions when Sturgeon, Swinney, MacAskill, Hyslop and even the maverick Russell were not acting in concert and refining their plan of action for the first 100 days of eventual SNP government. Yet on those fleeting occasions when they have dropped the ball, Labour has also been found wanting in pressing home the advantage. Their utter defenestration and humiliation in 2011 at the hands of a hardened and efficient government machine was inevitable.</p><p>On the day Iain Gray finally demitted office and Salmond patronised him and ruffled his hair he must then have appreciated how a Motherwell manager feels when an Old Firm boss approaches him at the end of another wretched cup final. For Labour supporters, it doesn't get much worse than this. And when Johann Lamont, the Labour member for Glasgow Pollok, was elected to succeed Gray it seemed that, for Scottish Labour, the party was finally over.</p><p>Lamont is a woman for whom commentators will reach for words such as \"redoubtable\", \"formidable\" or \"busy\". What they really mean is that they would normally expect to encounter someone like her foraging for comestibles in Tesco. That she represents one of Glasgow's edgier arrondissements completes the picture. Yet that is partly where her strength lies. There was a time, before Blair, Mandelson and Miliband hijacked the party, when a person such as Johann Lamont would have epitomised all that Labour represented: hard work, honesty, aspiration, integrity and compassion. She is Labour incarnate and her slogan might simply be: \"No nonsense\".</p><p>Even so, it was feared that, for all these qualities, she would simply be swept aside in debate with Alex Salmond. For the last 10 years or so, he has forsaken breakfast most Thursday mornings in the knowledge that he will have a Labour leader, seasoned and garnished, before the day is out. Ms Lamont, though, has risen to the challenge of facing him. She has rarely been bested at first minister's questions and has taken care in choosing the ground on which to engage her party's nemesis. She comes well prepared and does not lose her equanimity when the first minister's mouth assumes its default aspect which is halfway between a smirk and a snort.</p><p>Even in her bad moments, she retains her composure and emerges with dignity. One of these occurred two weeks ago in an exchange about education. The SNP's sorcery when it quotes numbers in any discussion about learning is well known. If you listen for long enough to Mike Russell, the education minister, you may form the impression that every pupil in Scotland will become a doctor of philosophy by the time the nationalists have done with them. Lamont had talked about a nursery nurse for every child when she ought actually to have said that each child should have access to one. Salmond pounced in characteristic style, but in so doing merely sounded like a supercilious and hectoring bully. Ms Lamont is underneath his skin.</p><p>The new Labour leader's nerveless performances in the chamber have illuminated a curious phenomenon in Scottish Labour since 1999 and one that should make the party pause for reflection. With the exception of Jack McConnell and, to a lesser extent, Henry McLeish, Labour's real stars at Holyrood have all been women. Susan Deacon's performance at health in the first Holyrood Labour administration has never since been bettered, though Nicola Sturgeon is currently giving her a run for her money. McConnell, though, banished Deacon to the back-benches in reprisal for her failing to back him in the contest that gave him the leadership. Wendy Alexander, like Deacon, is also possessed of a fierce and acute intellect yet chose to resign as Labour leader for a minor fiscal infraction of which she'd had no knowledge. Holyrood is diminished by the continuing absence of these two.</p><p>And you have to wonder why Margaret Curran and Cathy Jamieson are ossifying within the most under-worked and irrelevant political grouping anywhere in the UK: the Scottish Labour group at Westminster. If these four had been occupying the senior frontbench places that their talents and experience deserved, then Scottish Labour would not currently be staring into the abyss. A lack of vision and an absence of strategic leadership meant that their rightful places are currently being filled by the eager and the busy, but sadly also the woebegotten.</p><p>What is it in the psyche of a substantial number of Scottish men that makes them fear and loathe women with brains? Joan McAlpine, the first minister's parliamentary liaison officer, will climb high within the SNP, but she is already finding out that being a woman with an intellect brings you grief both within and without your party. And if you think Nicola Sturgeon has escaped this then just wait until she tries to succeed Salmond as leader of the SNP.</p><p>For the moment, Johann Lamont need not concern herself with this. She is the unopposed mistress of Labour's destiny. And in her bustling and no-nonsense form, the old parties of the United Kingdom may just have found an unlikely champion as they fight to preserve the Union.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Scottish+National+party+%28SNP%29&k=Alex+Salmond&k=Scotland&k=Politics&k=UK+news&k=Labour\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=If+only+Holyrood+appreciated+woman+%7C+Kevin+McKenna+Article+1728412&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=SNP+%28Politics%29%2CAlex+Salmond%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CLabour&c3=The+Observer&c6=Kevin+McKenna&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1728412&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2012/apr/08/alex-salmond-holyrood-johann-lamont|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|315f4e4cbc0446f791e3ec37906cd817f4002701 -->",

          "headline": "The pleasures of rereading",
          "body": "<p>It usually starts with a pretence of steeliness. Not the whole thing, I'll tell myself, reaching for the ruined paperback. One chapter, a favourite passage, then I'll wedge it back in with those books begun but not yet finished; the dozens more bought or inherited that I honestly mean to open, sooner to get to all of Dickens. I'm a chronic rereader, mostly of novels, and it is a habit as coiled with guilt as it  is with pleasure, because every go-round with  a favourite is also another time I haven't read <em>Bleak House</em>.</p><p>The trouble is that a chapter or passage is never enough. The same qualities that seduced once seduce again. I've had watertight plans to parachute in at one of <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>'s irresistible mealtime scenes, read, and get out again; plans ruined by the compulsion to flick back a page, back a chapter – gah – back to the prologue. <em>The Go-Between</em> is my private demon. An innocent reminder, I'll think, how LP Hartley phrased his famous opening line… suddenly it's midnight and I'm 100 pages deep and Ted is oiling his shotgun.</p><p>The affliction struck early. For me, as for many kids of the 80s, novels were pitiful things if not written by Roald Dahl, and aged 10 or so I met the unusual dilemma of exhausting an author's catalogue. With <em>Matilda</em>, <em>The Witches</em> and the rest devoured, only Dahl's intimidating stream of adult stories and the latterly published <em>Esio Trot </em>were left. I thumbed through <em>Trot</em>, dismayed that it didn't have any obvious chocolate factories or marvellous medicines, instead a couple of moony pensioners and a tortoise. I supposed I could try it. Or (the option seemed amazing, possibly illegal) why not restart one of my favourites?</p><p>I haven't gone back to <em>Esio Trot</em> yet, and every reread since that first shaky reach for <em>Matilda</em> has been tinged with the same concern: that to refuse the new is to break some elemental code of literature. That to reread is lazy, maybe even impolite. So I've faked anticipation when somebody spots the paperback I'm carrying and says that I'll love Cecil when he appears in <em>A Room With a View</em> or that <em>Any Human Heart</em> gets very, very sad. I've thought about folding the dust-jacket of a pristine Mrs Gaskell around a battered Martin Amis, just to avoid a friend or relative asking: \"Again?\"</p><p>Examples mentioned here are personal. The novels that yoke the rereader are not universal – they're not always good. Some of the motivations and satisfactions, though, must be shared.</p><p>It is time travel, a reliable way to reawaken feelings sparked by a book at first encounter. George MacDonald Fraser's series of Flashman novels summons for me an early stretch at university, when I picked up one in a stranger's room, skimmed a paragraph, and realised with excitement and dread that my set-text reading plan would now implode. <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> brings back a thrilling first sense of professional life and the daily commute, Orwell's novel finished while travelling across town for work experience at 15. Salinger's slim book of stories will forever be a ski-trip coach that smelled not unpleasantly of Chewits; <em>Laughter in the Dark</em> a summer spent dumped and misanthropic and grateful for Nabokov's mean wit. <em>Howard's End</em> is the time I met my wife, opened every year since.</p><p>Security is a factor. Max Beerbohm's <em>Zuleika Dobson</em> was funny when last picked up and can fairly be expected to have stayed that way on the shelf. No need to gamble on new characters or a new set of circumstances – abstentions that for some would void the chief appeal of fiction are for the rereader a lure, because that massive investment of hours can be made without risk of disappointment. The last page of Steinbeck's brick-sized <em>East of Eden</em> will unfailingly thrill me. I sweat through Tom Ripley's police interviews every time.</p><p>Actually, those nervy near-arrests in <em>The Talented Mr Ripley</em> are a bit of an exception. Suspense is the first thing to die on a reread, and the experience is better for it. Familiar with the story, the plot on rails, the rereader can relax, look around and whistle at the scenery. I first read Marilynne Robinson's <em>Gilead</em> racked by an irrational fear that the old and ill narrator was going to croak on every next page. Only during a second and third read could I properly absorb Robinson's gentle wisdom.</p><p>Even when it gets silly (a fourth reread, a fifth, pages tugged loose and the book plump with place-holding Travelcards), old favourites can surprise. On a sixth or seventh lap of <em>The Go-Between</em>, I finally paid proper heed to Marcus Maudsley, that fantastic little shit of an 11-year-old who has all the polished procedural snobbery of a Victorian ancient. A bit-player once ignored, now treasured.</p><p>I wonder if Hartley intended Marcus to be a slow burner. Some novelists definitely anticipate the rereader and lay rewards. Nabokov slaps an outrageous spoiler on page two of <em>Lolita</em>, detectable only if you've finished it before. At the beginning of the first Harry Potter book (guilty), there's throwaway mention of a character who won't appear for two more sequels. The novelists might be rereaders themselves, this their show of fellowship. Or perhaps it's authorial swagger – confident assertion that, yeah, this is one of <em>those</em> books. The sort the rereader thwaps shut with a grunt, already reaching for Scotch Tape to strengthen the spine, smugly pondering the £7.99 investment that'll pay back again in two years, in four…</p><p>To freshen my memory before writing this, I carefully explored my book shelves, alert for scuffed bindings, squeezing paperbacks for the tell-tale crackle of sand and crisp-crumb. They weren't all there, my stalwarts, but I found them – some in a pile by the sofa, a few kicked under the bed, one hidden away in an old shoulder-bag. I'd seized them up when last ill or bored or moody or restless, in need of comfort.</p><p>Rereading is therapy, despite the accompanying dash of guilt, and I find it strange that not everybody does it. Why wouldn't you go back to something good? I return to these novels for the same reason I return to beer, or blankets or best friends.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/books&k=Fiction&k=Books&k=Culture&k=Best+books&k=Roald+Dahl&k=Vladimir+Nabokov\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+pleasures+of+rereading+Article+1727537&ch=Books&c2=148491&c4=Fiction+%28Books+genre%29%2CBooks%2CCulture%2CBest+books%2CRoald+Dahl%2CVladimir+Nabokov+%28Author%29%2CEM+Forster+%28Author%29&c3=The+Observer&c6=Tom+Lamont&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1727537&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: books/2012/apr/08/rereading-favourite-books-pleasure|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|e28c0735b23d73934f3592e9068995aea3bf10b9 -->",

This fifth album is arguably his most measured, setting his supple vocals to acoustic, subtly innovative arrangements. Dark-hued ballads take prominence and allow his flair for the tender and dramatic to shine. \"The Captain's Apprentice\" has a maritime, Brittanesque atmosphere, ghostly clanks attend \"The 18th of June\", while the stately \"Lord Douglas\" comes with accordion and pedal steel. By contrast, Anaïs Mitchell's \"If It's True\" gets a theatrical, orchestral treatment and a banjo-flaying version of Fleetwood Mac's \"Big Love\" is a surprising winner.

          "headline": "James Haskell scours globe to enrich his game en route back to Wasps",
          "body": "<p>If you should ever fancy an airgun pellet between the shoulder blades, you could do worse than cavort through the backcountry around Dunedin shouting, \"Woo-hoo, The Hask!\" The chances are you will tweak the nerves of James Haskell, who will almost certainly be out hunting somewhere nearby, armed with said weapon and urged on by Andrew Hore and his other new team-mates at the Highlanders.</p><p>\"Please don't refer to me as The Hask,\" he says politely, but with a clear undertone. Then he complains they all call him that in Dunedin, the latest city he calls home, before launching into an explanation of the provenance of a nickname he considers a travesty. It's something to do with a perception that he promotes himself as a brand.</p><p>It is true that he has his own website and is an avid user of social media, but for all his love of gadgets and techno-geekery there is something very old-fashioned about him as well. For a start, there's his proclivity for lying low in the wilderness of the South Island alongside grizzled All Black front-row forwards.</p><p>\"Andrew Hore is a big one for shooting,\" says Haskell. \"He describes it as doing a few jobs, so he'll come up to me and say, 'I've got a few jobs on. You interested?' Last time it was some rabbit shooting, a bit of pest clearance on the farm of a friend of his, with him and Jamie MacKintosh [the Highlanders captain and a prop forward capped by the All Blacks].\"</p><p>And then there's the fact that Haskell is to be found on the other side of the world at all, when every other English back-row forward of his calibre and generation is to be found up here, fighting for a place in the national team.</p><p>Haskell is ambitious, but not to the exclusion of everything else. His stint with the Highlanders in the Super 15 is the last leg of a three-year odyssey that has also taken him to Paris and Tokyo, before he returns to Wasps next season, the club where it all started. Never let it be said that he is shy of the more glamorous aspects of his profession, but this journey smacks more of a passion to see the world and to live life.</p><p>\"It takes a lot of sacrifices to come over here. You're leaving your friends and family to go to a place where you don't know anyone. Financially, over here it's a&nbsp;very different ball game. The money just isn't competitive, so you have to make it a purely rugby decision. And you've got to give up your England place. So I don't think this will become a common move.\"</p><p>Ah, his England place. It might have been forgotten – amid all the recent excitement over England's ascension from \"the gutter\", as Graham Rowntree put it – that their growing stock of options in the back row will soon be supplemented further by the return of Haskell. England's descent into the depths was so vertiginous and so quickly reversed that it is tempting to ask whether it ever really happened. As someone who has seen England from the inside and out in recent times, Haskell's a good person to ask.</p><p>\"It is up to Wig [Rowntree], his choice of words, but it was a difficult period of time. People made mistakes. But the problem with anything in life is that if you just focus on the media, without any inside knowledge of what went on, you naturally have a biased opinion. Everyone wanted an England team to be proud of [at the World Cup] and they were disappointed. If you took everything that was written at face value — that the guys were on a stag do and so on — then it helped to compound the problems and put English rugby into a dark place. But with the new coaches it's on the way up again and back to where it should be. Guys are focused on performance and the talk is about the rugby, and nothing else.\"</p><p>Haskell did not get to watch much of the Six Nations and what he did see was in highlights packages. Kick-off times in the northern hemisphere make it very difficult for those in New Zealand to follow rugby up here and this is reflected in their indifference towards it. There is an amusing video on the internet in which Haskell asks some of his Highlanders team-mates their opinions of northern-hemisphere rugby. The more mischievous (Hore, for example) use it as a chance to indulge in banter about how boring it is, but all of them confess to not knowing because they never watch any of it. This is one&nbsp;of several cultural differences Haskell has had to embrace during his recent adventures.</p><p>\"It's interesting. You ask people in England what they think of Super 15, they'll have a lot more comments than the other way round. That's what I've always found with Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. They just focus on what they're doing, whereas in the UK we look outwards more. Talking to the guys who are All Blacks, when they're preparing for an international they do some analysis on patterns of play, but they don't focus on the minutiae of their opponents. Some players might disagree, but I reckon if you asked an All Black after a game who his opposite number was, most of the time he wouldn't know, unless it was someone like Jonny Wilkinson.\"</p><p>After the World Cup, Haskell went to Japan to play alongside Ma'a Nonu and Tamati Ellison for Ricoh Black Rams for a few months. He describes Japanese rugby as the fastest he has ever played. The players are so well drilled that skill levels are higher than in the Top 14 in France, where you might see 10 or 15 balls go down in a Stade Français training session. But the French are infused with their natural flair and a ferocious devotion to physicality. Their emotions fluctuate wildly. Japanese emotions can run high too, but they are tempered by the attention to drills. In New Zealand, the approach is more recognisable to an Anglo-Saxon one, but they are blessed with a culture that promotes touch rugby from a young age, with less focus on weights and conditioning.</p><p>After such an experience, Haskell will surely return to England a better player than he was when he left on a two-year deal with Stade Français in 2009, and it is to his credit that he has seen fit to embark on such an adventure. It was noticeable how improved his form for England was in the 2011 Six Nations, courtesy of his French sojourn, and Wasps (in particular) and England will wait with interest to see how he returns from his subsequent stints in Japan and New Zealand.</p><p>\"I wanted to play Super 15. I wanted to develop some maturity, some leadership and to work on my skill set. Also I want to have played all round the world. Then you can come to informed opinions. People make very many comments in life when they don't have the background or the knowledge. I'll be able to tell you what it's like in four of the big leagues in the rugby world. I've had a great experience. I've played with some of the best players in the world, and I've loved every minute of it.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=England+rugby+union+team&k=New+Zealand+rugby+union+team&k=Stade+Fran%C3%A7ais&k=Rugby+union&k=Sport\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=James+Haskell+scours+globe+to+enrich+his+game+en+route+back+to+Wasps+%7C+Michael+Aylwin+Article+1728430&ch=Sport&c2=148491&c4=England+rugby+union+team%2CNew+Zealand+rugby+union+team%2CStade+Francais+%28Rugby+union%29%2CRugby+union%2CSport&c3=The+Observer&c6=Michael+Aylwin&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1728430&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2012/apr/07/james-haskell-england-new-zealand-rugby|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|a23f98449e1e904bddb9bbdd1fa78361a283af59 -->",

          "body": "<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong>Preamble</strong> It was never a problem. Chasing small totals, it was never a problem. England could be hope-shreddingly inept at everything else if they liked but, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;innings_number=4;orderby=start;qualmax1=149;qualval1=target;result=2;spanmin2=15+Mar+1977;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;type=team;view=innings\">unlike those mentally weak Aussies</a>, they knew how to knock off small totals. Between 1903 and 2011, England had a target of between 100 and 149 to win a Test on 26 occasions. Their record was almost perfect: W23 D2 L1. Twice they ran out of time; once, famously, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63203.html\">they were Hadleed in Christchurch</a>.</p><p>Then Abu Dhabi happened. England did not just fail to reach a target of 145 against Pakistan in January; they failed to make half of it. They are likely to have another tricky little chase against Sri Lanka today; if so, they will have to cope with the Sri Lanka spin attack of Herath, Randiv and Demons. </p><p>Sri Lanka will resume on 218 for six, a lead of 33. That score is slightly deceptive, however, because England's six wickets include two nightwatchmen. They still need to dismiss at least two of Angelo Mathews, Prasanna Jayawardene and Mahela Jayawardene, although they do have a newish ball to work with. You might as well set up camp behind the sofa. This could well be what Ashley Giles used to describe as an \"arse-nipper\".</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>A quick recap of what this match means in terms of the ICC rankings</strong></p><p>• If England win, they stay No1 in the world</p><p>• If they draw, they drop below South Africa </p><p>• If they lose, they drop below South Africa and could be overtaken by Australia by the end of the month</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>5.15am GMT / 12.15am ET</strong> \"I see you've got a big piece in the Times today,\" says Alex Davies. \"Playing away are we?\" </p><p>Oh, that's taken from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wisden-Cricketers-Almanack-Lawrence-Booth/dp/1408156342/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333771671&amp;sr=8-1\">Lawrence Booth's Wisden Almanack</a>, which is available in all good bookshops from Wednesday. I suppose this is the bit where I should humblebrag along the lines of '1500 pages, all those amazing writers and they choose little ol' me for the first extract!', but London phonies have ruined self-deprecation so I'll keep the actual self-loathing for myself.</p><p>On a happier note, congratulations to our old friend Booth. Wisden Almanack editor! To me, he'll always be the man propping up the bar during a midweek fiasco in Leicester Square O'Neill's ...</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>Anyone out there?</strong> Someone must be on the 274B bus home, or some such.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>92nd over: Sri Lanka 219-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 56, Mathews 3)</strong> Mathews is dropped in the first over of the day! He pushed a nasty delivery from Swann towards short leg, where Cook put down a sharp chance down by his left ankle. \"I'm on Moreton Island,\" says Charlie Clover, who already has one up on me, \"surrounded by genteel tattooed Queensland women and fat kids. Paradise. However I can't help but wonder if I'll be covered with XXXX (washed down with a knuckle sanga) if I go to the resort bar to ask them to turn off the NRL, and put on the England cricket. Thoughts?\" Do what needs to be done. Or, better still, get somebody else to do it for you.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>93rd over: Sri Lanka 221-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 3)</strong> It'll be the marvellous Jimmy Anderson at the other end. Can he produce one last new-ball burst to complete a brilliant personal winter? It's a good first over, in which Jayawardene touches two to fine leg. \"I'm here Rob, following the OBO in a dark hotel room in Siem Reap, Cambodia when I should be out looking at ancient temples or at least drinking local beer,\" says Joe Minihane.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>94th over: Sri Lanka 222-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 4)</strong> Jayawardene pads up to a big off break from Swann, bringing the inevitable LBW appeal, but there was far too much doubt for Bruce Oxenford to give that. Swann has started well; so has Jayawardene, whose defence looks airtight. \"I'm up and ready and have the fingernails ready,\" says Mona Stead. \"A lovely 20 degress in Melbourne.\"</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>REVIEW! Sri Lanka 223-6 (Jayawardene not out 58)</strong> Jayawardene has been given out LBW! Asad Rauf took an <em>age</em> to give it. It was a magnificently theatrical appeal from Anderson, who was beseeching Asad Rauf to raise the finger. I thought Jayawardene was just outside the line, but it was very close. There might have been an inside edge as well. In fact, he definitely inside-edged it. The front-on replays aren't clear but you can see it from the camera behind the batsman. This will be overturned by Rod Tucker. Yes, <strong>Jayawardene survives</strong>, and both sides have one review remaining.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>95th over: Sri Lanka 223-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 5)</strong> Sri Lanka's lead is <strong>38</strong>. \"Ah Larry Booth,\" says Oliver Pattenden. \"Or 'Mr. Booth' as my ex-girlfriend from university used to call him. I'd be up writing a paper, OBO in the background, emailing in various quips or opinions, and she'd joke 'cheating on me with Mr. Booth again?'. And in the years after we graduated, I'd be occupied with a match, eschewing one of her family events. And, more sternly this time, she'd ask 'what do I say to my parents? You're busy with Mr. Booth?'. Of course time moved on. Booth left the Guardian. She and I broke up. Booth wrote for different papers. She and I dated new people. She no longer returns my emails. You never post mine. I guess that's the nature of change. There's no harm in nostalgia and regret, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt.\"</p><p>That's beautifully sad. Sort of. It's like the bit in (500) Days of Summer where he makes the same joke at two different points in time, only the second time is when the relationship is crumbling, and she doesn't laugh. The breakdown of a relationship through the prism of Lawrence Booth. Who'd have thought?</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>96th over: Sri Lanka 224-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 6)</strong> Jayawardene is beaten by a gorgeous delivery from Swann that skids straight on. Swann is bowling superbly here.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>97th over: Sri Lanka 225-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 7)</strong> Mathews edges Anderson a fraction short of Swann at second slip. This has been a seriously purposeful start from England. They know how vital it is to take wickets while the ball is fairly new. Anderson is trying to unsettle Mathews with a few verbals.</p><p>\"Having just got back from Canada yesterday lunchtime I am now suffering from a severe bout of jet lag,\" says Ian Mell. \"This means I've been up most of the night working and I'm not sure I can cope with England chasing a sub -200 total today. If we all ask nicely do you think England can do the honourable thing and skittle Sri Lanka in the next half hour so that we may be able to chase 100 before lunchtime?\" Comfortable wins are for wimps. Make mine an arse-nipper.*<br /><em><br />* Guardian man reserves the right to amend this entry later in the day if England are 90 for eight chasing 101.</em></p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>98th over: Sri Lanka 227-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 59, Mathews 8)</strong> Mathews feels nervously at Swann, inside-edging onto the pad and not far wide of Cook at short leg. \"I am out here, Rob,\" says Ian Copestake, \"and I just want to say that I love you.\" No, Copestake, it's I just <em>called</em> to say I love you. You've ruined a potentially perfect moment with inadequate knowledge of Stevie Wonder song titles.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>99th over: Sri Lanka 232-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 60, Mathews 12)</strong> Mathews pulls Anderson superbly for  the first boundary of the day – and the first since the 77th over in fact. That's Anderson's fourth over of the morning. He probably has one more at most.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>100th over: Sri Lanka 233-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 61, Mathews 12)</strong> Mathews is dropped again by Cook at short leg! This was another sharp chance, low to his right when Mathews pushed at another good delivery from Swann. They are not easy in that position, although I reckon Ian Bell would have taken at least one of them. Swann is bowling a beautiful spell and beats Mathews on the outside two balls later. In other news, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/StuartBroad8/status/188365872623132672\">Stuart Broad is single</a>. An orderly one please, ladies, an orderly one.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>101st over: Sri Lanka 236-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 62, Mathews 14)</strong> Tim Bresnan replaces Jimmy Anderson at the Janashakthi End. Three from the over, so Sri Lanka's lead is now 51. \"On a more prosaic note,\" begins Ian Copestake, \"I do think Oliver Pattenden has grounds for suing Booth for loss of booty.\"</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 238-7 (M Jayawardene c Cook b Swann 64)</strong> Graeme Swann has got Mahela Jayawardene with a beauty! That should be a matchwinning breakthrough. It was a horrible delivery that turned and bounced to hit the glove before deflecting onto the body and up in the air.  Cook, diving forward from short leg, took a comfortable catch. That was close to unplayable. It's the end of an immaculate defensive innings from Jayawardene – 64 from 191 balls with four fours – and Swann has yet another five-wicket haul.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>102nd over: Sri Lanka 238-7 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 14, P Jayawardene 0)</strong> \"Morning Smyth, morning everybody,\" says Josh Robinson. \"I'm here (for values of here that include Berlin). And have just about recovered from jet-lag. I've discovered that even if you can't get to sleep until 4 or 5, getting up to follow the Test is a good enough way of ensuring that after a few days you'll be so exhausted that you collapse in bed at about 9.30pm (much to the chagrin of your partner) and are back on a more or less normal rhythm shortly afterwards. More or less normal means that I'm sending relatively inane emails to you, of course. Flight back to Stansted tonight, and then Sawyer's joining me for a trip to Fenner's to watch the last day of the Lancashire game tomorrow. I suppose there are worse ways to spend the Easter weekend.\" Diane Sawyer?</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>103rd over: Sri Lanka 240-7 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 16, P Jayawardene 0)</strong> \"I have an engineering entrance exam tomorrow but here I am sitting on my table constantly refreshing the OBO page instead of umm, lets say, solving Simple Harmonic motion problems,\" says Utkarsh Sharma. \"But I will tell you one thing, there is absolutely no need of chirping in a sentence like 'Anyone out there' in the updates. It makes me feel guilty of being the only one wasting time this way.\"</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 242-8 (P Jayawardene b Swann 2)</strong> Got him! Swann has picked up two Jayawardenes in as many overs. Prasanna Jayawardene had almost fallen twice earlier in the over when he missed a sweep shot and was bowled behind his legs. That's a dreadful stroke. Swann has six for 92; he should really end up with an eight-for here. He also has ten in the match for the second time in his Test career.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>104th over: Sri Lanka 242-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 16, Herath 0)</strong> England are into the tail now, with just Herath and Lakmal to come. Mathews should probably go into one-day mode and try to smack Sri Lanka towards a three-figure lead. Herath is beaten a beauty first ball.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>105th over: Sri Lanka 247-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 21, Herath 0)</strong> Mathews does go into one-day mode, slugging Bresnan to long on for four. He is an extremely dangerous hitter. \"Please can you politely tell all the people in hot sunny places to [rude word] off?\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"It wasn't funny when an inch of snow fell last weekend, it was even less funny to get up this morning and find two more inches had fallen. The Estonian cricket season is unlikely to be starting at Easter this year. In other news, those who don't want an arse-nipper could consider that if Sri Lanka bat until teatime it probably won't be a close finish.\"</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>106th over: Sri Lanka 248-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 22, Herath 0)</strong> Mathews is still taking singles when they are on offer, as he does in that over when he reverse sweeps Swann straight onto the shin of Anderson at slip. Had Anderson stood still he might have taken the catch, but he had moved to his right once he saw Mathews shaping to reverse sweep.</p><p>\"I'm currently in Manhattan, New York, following the OBO,\" says Zubair Shah. \"By coincidence I'm staying at my cousin's house, Zul Jamal, who is one of the investors in <a href=\"http://deathofagentlemanfilm.com/\">Death of a Gentleman</a>. I'm trying to find a single channel out of the 1024 on his TV that is showing the game. I've found a duck race, a 'how to loosen your bowels' infomercial and a 'god bless good hygiene' feature. Alas no Test match. You continue to be my only saviour.\" A saviour? Little ol' me?</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>107th over: Sri Lanka 250-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Herath 1)</strong> Tim Bresnan is replaced by Samit Patel. This is a decent move, as Mathews might find it harder to go after spin than seam. He drives a single to long on, and Herath mows another single into the leg side. Sri Lanka lead by <strong>65</strong>.</p><p>\"Hi there from Friday night in Quito,\" says Steve Bennett. \"Have just been to a 'British pub' (the Turtle's Head, hardy ha) which was showing nothing but rally and baseball, and serving a selection of British lagers including Heinekin and Miller draft. Forget finding a place to watch the cricket, does anyone know a place in Quito which sells decent beer? I'm in an Aussie-run backpacker hostel. An England win would go down nicely with breakfast tomorrow, thanks.\" I'll see what I can do.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>108th over: Sri Lanka 251-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Herath 2)</strong> Herath is beaten by a jaffa from Swann. That was far too good for a No10. One from the over. \"I'm out here,\" says Mac Millings, \"if by 'here' you mean 'following England clumsily hide inevitable defeat behind the illusion of likely victory'. Also, I think the 102nd over's Josh Robinson is referring to Sawyer out of 'Lost' – a man so grubbily handsome that, just when it all finally seemed so clear, you'll question your orientation all over again. Either him or OBO regular Phil Sawyer, a man so grubbily etc and so forth.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 251-9 (Herath c Anderson b Patel 2)</strong> Herath was never going to last long. He propped forward to a delivery from Patel that didn't turn as much as he expected and edged it straight to Anderson at slip.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>REVIEW! Sri Lanka 251-9 (Lakmal not out 0)</strong> England have used their last review. Lakmal got his bat jammed against his boot as he tried to play a very full delivery from Patel. The ball hit him on the toe and then looped up into the hands of Matt Prior. I don't think there was any bat involved; even if there was, the evidence is nowhere near conclusive enough. So Lakmal survives. Still, it was worth a try with only one wicket remaining. It maintains England's 100 per cent DRS record in this series: 10 reviews, none successful.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>109th over: Sri Lanka 251-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews must surely farm the strike now. \"My girlfriend, Shelagh, is preparing to open her new cafe in Shoreditch on Tuesday,\" says Mat Neale. \"Thanks to her I've been awake for the start of play for the last couple of days, so that's worth a shameless plug I feel.\" Sure, why not. <a href=\"http://www.salvationjanecafe.co.uk/\">Who fancies a little bit of Australia in Shoreditch</a>?</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>110th over: Sri Lanka 252-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 24, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews declines a single from Swann's third delivery and then heaves a single to long on from the fifth.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>111th over: Sri Lanka 260-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 32, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews laps Patel for four and then crashes the last ball of the over through point for four. Sri Lanka lead by 75, but Swann now should have a full over at Lakmal. \"Do you also reserve the right to change the time?\" says John Starbuck. \"You should, as we are now in BST: GMT was overtaken some time ago but in your content early-rising condition you probably didn't notice.\"</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>112th over: Sri Lanka 264-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 32, Lakmal 4)</strong> Lakmal inside edges Swann just short of Cook at short leg and then drives him through extra cover for four!</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>113th over: Sri Lanka 265-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 33, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews keeps the strike with a single off the last ball of Patel's over. \"Adding to the weight of local non-exotic localizations, I'm up with my 18-month old daughter in a chilly Dorset, placating her with endless cheery technicolor productions on CBeebies that should really be barred from this unearthly hour and toasted fruit bread,\" says Richard Rowe. \"In return she's just about allowing me to follow the Test on the OBO. Any thoughts of sneakily switching on TMS are met with squealing demands to get 3rd And Bird back on the tellybox.\"</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>114th over: Sri Lanka 270-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 38, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews reverse sweeps Swann to third man for four and then takes a single from the fourth delivery. Lakmal survives the rest of the over.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>115th over: Sri Lanka 271-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 39, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews drives Patel's last ball for a single, and on we go with this mildly irritating last-wicket stand. Sri Lanka lead by 86. \"Following OBO in Nairobi instead of getting dressed to go a cousin's wedding,\" says Daudi Were. \"Would any of your readers know if we're meant to wear trousers under a Ugandan kanzu? The wife wants us in Ugandan high fashion today.\"</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>116th over: Sri Lanka 272-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 40, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews take a single from Swann's fourth ball, and Lakmal does the necessary. He has looked comfortable, actually, for somebody who is supposed to be a rank tailender.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>117th over: Sri Lanka 277-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 45, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews blasts Patel for four and then, again, keeps the strike with a single off the last ball. \"Daudi Were?\" says Mike Selvey of the email in the 115th over. \"Is that the fellow who used to soar in the lineout for Scotland, and much loved of Bill McLaren?\"</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>118th over: Sri Lanka 278-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 46, Lakmal 4)</strong> See 116th over.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 278 all out (Mathews c Strauss b Finn 46)</strong> A good bowling change from Andrew Strauss ends a pesky last-wicket partnership. Mathews had become a bit too comfortable so Strauss went for a change of pace, bringing on Steven Finn for Samit Patel. Mathews, undone by a bit of uneven bounce, looped a short ball to Strauss, who took a good catch running back from midwicket. That's the end of the morning session, and it's been a job well done by England. After lunch they will need <strong>94</strong> to square the series and stay top of the ICC rankings. It should be a comfortable victory. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSRN8O4ULQs#t=10m27s\">Should</a>.</p><p>\"Suggest Daudi Were goes commando to the wedding,\" phwoars Robyn Adams. \"Should enliven the maiden aunts and possibly the bridesmaids – may even provoke enough of a row with the girlfriend for him to 'huff' off into the car and get the cricket on this radio.\"</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>There have been two instances</strong> of a <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;innings_number=4;orderby=team_score;qualmax1=99;qualval1=target;result=2;template=results;type=team;view=innings\">team losing a Test when chasing a target of below 100</a>: England against Australia at The Oval in 1882 and Zimbabwe in Trinidad in 2000. Sri Lanka need early wickets to have any chance, and they will surely start with spin from both ends.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 0-1 (Strauss b Dilshan 0)</strong> Andrew Strauss has gone in the first over! He felt down the wrong line at a delivery from the offspinner Tillakaratne Dilshan that turned to hit the off stump. It was an odd shot from Strauss, an absent-minded poke with a crooked bat and a slightly closed face.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>2nd over: England 4-1 (target: 94; Cook 3, Trott 1)</strong> It'll be spin from both ends, with Rangana Herath sharing the new ball. Cook forces three through the covers. England will be fine here; there's no need to do the whole despair thing. \"Being as I'm getting married to the beautiful Hayley Belle Furminger in a couple of hours, I feel rather chipper this fine morning,\" says Miles Geffin. \"That said, a cataclysmic batting collapse may well adversely impact on my mood. Is it terribly cowardly to pray for rain?\"</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>3rd over: England 6-1 (target: 94; Cook 4, Trott 1)</strong> England are playing more positively than they did in that Abu Dhabi run-chase, when they stood passively while the soil fell over their head. Trott misses a pull at Dilshan and then flicks a single to midwicket. Cook pushes another single into the off side. \"Regardless of whether you publish this, please forward it to Daudi Were as a matter of urgency: yes, definitely trousers under a kanzu,\" says Josh Robinson. \"These things are sufficiently translucent that not wearing them will be a considerable social faux pas. If you weren't already posting on the OBO I'd also suggest that it would injure your dignity.\"</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>REVIEW! England 8-1 (Trott not out 2)</strong> Trott survives a huge shout for LBW from Herath, and Sri Lanka are going to review the decision. He played around his pad at a fullish delivery; I don't think it straightened enough to  hit the stumps. Hawkeye shows it was indeed missing leg stump, so Trott continues.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>4th over: England 9-1 (target: 94; Cook 6, Trott 2)</strong> \"I'm following the action from the beach in Peru, explaining the delights of five day cricket to a Dutchman,\" says Chris Hodgson. \"I'm also the manager of the Peruvian national cricket team – any chance of a shout out to the Llamas?\" Damn straight. Go follow them on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/CricketPeru\">that Twitter thing</a>.\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>5th over: England 11-1 (target: 94; Cook 7, Trott 3)</strong> Two from Dilshan's over. The ball isn't misbehaving too much; just a little uneven bounce and the odd bit of sharp spin. \"I'm following the OBO from Kigali, which is a little like Slough, in case anyone was thinking of visiting,\" touristboards Will Rollason. \"In response to Daudi Were (over 115), and as a professional anthropologist, I can confidently say that in questions of other peoples' traditional costume: trousers, always trousers.\"</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>6th over: England 13-1 (target: 94; Cook 8, Trott 4)</strong> Trott inside edges a quicker one from Herath onto the pad. Run-scoring will not be easy unless KP goes mad again but England are going about this in the right way, looking for singles whenever possible.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>7th over: England 22-1 (target: 94; Cook 17, Trott 4)</strong> A good over for England begins when Cook smashes Dilshan straight down the ground for four, an effective agricultural blow. The next ball is a peach that turns sharply to take a thick edge. The ball after that is too short and cut decisively for four more.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>8th over: England 27-1 (target: 94; Cook 22, Trott 4)</strong> Four more to Cook, slammed through the covers when Herath drops one short and wide. He has raced to 21 from 31 balls. \"How jaded by his own success is Chris Hodgson (4th over)?\" says Matt Dony. \"He emails in to say he's on a beach, and then as an afterthought mentions that he just happens to be manager of an international sports team?\"</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>9th over: England 31-1 (target: 94; Cook 25, Trott 5)</strong> Cook pats Dilshan into the leg side for two and is then beaten by a beauty from Dilshan. Asad Rauf goes to the third umpire to check the stumping, just in case, but Cook was fine. </p><p>\"If it helps Robin Hazelhurst feel any worse, it's also warm and sunny in Saigon,\" says Dan Hatfield. \"Not as warm and sunny as Colombo though – I got back from there yesterday. Highlights of the trip include watching KP make his 151 and my insane Irish friend essentially molesting Ian Botham in the hotel bar.\"</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 31-2 (Trott LBW b Herath 5)</strong> That's not a bad shout for LBW, you know. Trott pushed forward at Herath, bat and pad very close together, and the ball hit him on the front pad around the line of off stump. There was a fairly muted shout for LBW from Sri Lanka. Asad Rauf said not out but Jayawardene, almost as an afterthought, decided to risk the last review. This will be close. He was a long way forward but bounce is rarely an issue with Herath. Did Trott get outside the line? He's out! It was in line and hitting middle and leg halfway up. Is that one last DRS wicket for the plane or the start of a tragifarcical collapse?</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>10th over: England 34-2 (target: 94; Cook 26, Pietersen 2)</strong> Pietersen comes down the track to his first ball, driving it to mid on for a single. \"Congratulations to Miles and the soon to be (please please please) Mrs Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen,\" says Niall Mullen. I don't get the joke. It's not rude is it? <em>Is something brilliant happening?</em></p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>11th over: England 39-2 (target: 94; Cook 30, Pietersen 3)</strong> It's friends reunited, with Dilshan bowling to Pietersen. He sweeps a single and then Cook cuts crisply for four. He is playing very nicely.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>12th over: England 44-2 (target: 94; Cook 33, Pietersen 5)</strong> Four from Herath's over. England are cruising. Put the Starship song on. \"Alas that is very rude,\" says Ian Copestake. \"In German Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen euphemistically translated means, England are going to flaming well ballls this up.\"</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>13th over: England 46-2 (target: 94; Cook 34, Pietersen 6)</strong> Suraj Randiv is coming on in place of Tillakaratne Dilshan. This will be interesting, because he was savaged by Pietersen in the first innings, who hit him for 39 from 17 deliveries. Here he settles for a single through point.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>14th over: England 47-2 (target: 94; Cook 35, Pietersen 6)</strong> Cook, trying to cut, is beaten thrice by quicker balls from Herath. That was beautifully bowled. \"What are the chances of the weather saving England?\" says Robin Hazlehurst? \"Any sign of rain around there? Or snow? They can have some of ours, we've got loads of the [rude word] stuff to spare. In April. At Easter. Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen doesn't even come close to describing it.\" Apparently they did have the covers ready earlier, but it all looks fine from my King's Cross vantage point.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>15th over: England 53-2 (target: 94; Cook 41, Pietersen 6)</strong> A fine stroke from Cook, who drills Randiv through extra cover for four to take England past 50. Nothing can go wrong for England here, and I'm not just saying that so as to tempt fate because I'm a tension junkie.</p><p>\"I'm following this from a beach in Bali where I'm married to the president's daughter and captain the international swingball team,\" says Peter Harmer. \"Fine, that's a lie. I'm following from a mattress on the floor of a small flat in N London. I'm sorry, I just felt so inadequate.\" </p><p>What's the most Mittyish thing any of you have done? Come on, out with it. I think I tried to impress a girl once by telling her I'd spoken to Lauren Laverne after a gig. Not made out with her or anything jazzy; <em>spoken</em> to her. Talk about aiming high.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>16th over: England 63-2 (target: 94; Cook 41, Pietersen 16)</strong> Effortless brutality from Pietersen, who gives Herath the charge and drives him down the ground for a wonderful flat six. That's Pietersen's seventh six of the match, a new record for this fixture. The next ball is blitzed emphatically over mid off for four more.</p><p>\"It's my 15th wedding anniversary today,\" says Simon McMahon. \"1997, England had just returned from New Zealand and an Ashes summer was about to begin. 600 Tests later, however, and despite my best efforts, Mrs McMahon (and now two daughters, Evie and Anna) have not the slightest interest in this wonderful game. Maybe  a mention in the OBO will change their mind? And make up for the fact that I forgot to buy a present (15 is crystal, apparently).\" You could always buy her Lawrence Booth's Wisden Almanack 2012 as a belated present. I hear the statistical analysis of the first 2000 Tests is to <em>die</em> for.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>17th over: England 71-2 (target: 94; Cook 42, Pietersen 22)</strong> Pietersen switch hits Randiv to third man for four. All above board this time, as he did not switch his hands until Randiv was into his delivery stride. Pietersen has 22 from 19 balls; he is batting like a lord.</p><p>\"Talk of Doddie Weir, however tangentially, always reminds me of the peerless Bill McLaren's description of him as 'on the charge like a mad giraffe',\" says Stephen Davenport. \"Which is perhaps only surpassed by Simon Geoghegan's appearance at the ruck: 'all arms and legs like a mad octopus'. Cricket commentary could do with a few more zoological similes, don't you think?\" Definitely. Sky had Freddie Flintoff commentating on the Darts in 2010; they should return the favour and get Sid Waddell in for a county game.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>18th over: England 76-2 (target: 94; Cook 46, Pietersen 23)</strong> Dilshan replaces Herath and is cut for four by Cook. \"There was a long queue in the nightclub cloakrooms once, so me and two other chaps kept our coats on in the meantime,\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"A charming and very attractive young lady came over to us and asked why we had leather jackets on, so I obviously replied that it was because we were members of the Russian mafia. When she looked nonplussed I pulled out a Russian visa from my pocket and told her it was my mafia ID. She walked off looking more pitying than impressed. Apparently Russian mafioso is not a very good thing to claim to be if you want to wow the ladies.\" Do you have a cut-glass accent? Maybe that gave the game away.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>19th over: England 81-2 (target: 94; Cook 49, Pietersen 26)</strong> Herath has changed ends. That probably means the end of a disappointing match for Randiv, who took just one wicket for 123. Cook repels a spitting delivery and then sweeps over the top for a couple. \"It's my 20th anniversary,\" says David Toze. \"As a failsafe, I bought myself a copy of \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cricket-Golden-Extraordinary-Images-1859/dp/184403237X\">Cricket the Golden Age</a>\" by Duncan Steer, since no one else was going to buy it for me. If anyone out there is interested as to why famous fast bowling metrosexual Bob Willis says \"the luncheon interval\" the answer is on P236…\" I'm confused. It's <em>your</em> 20th? And you bought a present for yourself? Does that mean you're married to you?</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>19.4 overs: England 97-2. ENGLAND WIN BY EIGHT WICKETS (Cook 49, Pietersen 42)</strong> Pietersen ends the match in a hurry, larruping his BFF Dilshan for 16 from four consecutive deliveries, the last of those a lofted six over midwicket. He ends with 42 from 28 balls and 193 from 193 balls in the match. That's an astonishing performance on an awkward pitch, and he and Graeme Swann will now have a zesty, borderline-homoerotic arm-wrestle for the Man of the Match award. More importantly, England have won the match, drawn the series and ensured they will be No1 in the Test rankings when they play the West Indies next month.</p><p>That's an excellent victory for England, a happy ending to a difficult few months.

          "headline": "Problem solved",
          "body": "<p><strong>I have been subfertile since I was 20.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am now 30 and about to undergo my last lot of IVF. &nbsp;My husband and I&nbsp;have decided there is no point in flogging a&nbsp;dead horse – my eggs are like those of&nbsp;someone much older, due&nbsp;to the complex medical issues behind the infertility. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Throughout our relationship, my husband has had a friend with various drug and alcohol problems. He is now sober-ish and has&nbsp;met someone and, after a month, they decided to start trying to conceive. Because of her fertility issues with her last partner, they are&nbsp;trying to get a referral for IVF. They are in their mid- to late-30s. I&nbsp;dread them succeeding where we may fail. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>I know it is not a failure as such, but I do not think I would be able to cope with my husband's friend becoming a&nbsp;father and my husband not. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The friend and the new girl have moved in together, and he is not in employment and not sober either. My&nbsp;husband is the only one who offered support through his 20-year-plus drug issues.&nbsp;He is now just drinking, and emotionally stuck at 17. Every time they argue, he declares it is over and we are expected to comfort his girlfriend of three months – yet they are still trying for a baby. I could&nbsp;scream!</strong></p><p><strong>In the past 10 years, I have navigated so many pregnancies, and we have three close friends who are pregnant: it&nbsp;does not bother me, but this friend does. I fear I am being unfair in focusing my anger on this man. I feel no emotion for the girlfriend; I would not wish her to remain childless. But I&nbsp;dread him having a baby, especially at this time in my life. </strong></p><p><strong>This feeling is magnified when I think that, in the last five years, we have ended up having to rescue three of his pets. I don't anticipate having to&nbsp;do the same with a baby, really, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am so bitter and angry that I am trying to avoid them, as the thought of&nbsp;his happiness makes me want to hurt him. What can I do? <em>L</em></strong></p><p></p><p>I would be amazed if, after what you have been through, you weren't angry, bitter and feeling that life was unfair. You need to allow yourself to have these feelings: they are valid. It is OK to rant against the world. But some of your feelings are tipping over into something else, and to be able to move on, you need to address where the wound lies.</p><p>I contacted <a href=\"http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Philippa Whittick, a systemic family psychotherapist</a>. She wondered what the friend represents: \"Who is he in your transference? Who does he represent? Why do you identify with him and not the girlfriend?\"</p><p>Because while it is perfectly understandable for you to feel angry, when one person triggers the depth of feeling he does, there is usually something else going on too.</p><p>It could be that to rant against the world, at this unfairness, is too abstract for you, you may need a \"target\" and it may be easier – less damaging – to have this friend as the bullseye than, say, your husband. I am not saying you  <em>should</em> also be angry at your husband, but I wondered if you <em>might</em> be.</p><p>Have you told your husband how you&nbsp;feel? I can't help thinking that you&nbsp;haven't. I&nbsp;wonder why your husband feels he keeps having to bail out this friend.</p><p>Whittick thought it would be really helpful for you both to see a therapist together to \"explore what it's like for them to be a couple who want a child and can't have one. What nerve has this man and his girlfriend hit? What's stopping you from saying: 'What a great opportunity for them, this might be the making of them?'\" She also thought it would be a good opportunity for you to talk about the \"triangular\" friendship you and your husband have with this friend.</p><p>Sometimes, when one can't have a&nbsp;child, various other people may become pregnant and it does not trigger anything, but then, one particular couple has a baby and suddenly, all those emotions come flooding out.</p><p>Do you feel as if they are having your baby – the baby you should have had? Do you&nbsp;worry about your husband potentially having to be, as Whittick put it, \"parental with someone else's child\" – viz the idea that you may be left looking after, in some way, this couple's baby?</p><h2>Your problems solved</h2><p></p><p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email <a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.
